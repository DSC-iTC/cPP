== Foreword
This is a Supporting Document (SD), intended to complement the Common Criteria CC:2022 Release 1 and the associated Common Evaluation Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation.

SDs may be "Guidance Documents," that highlight specific approaches and application of the standard to areas where no mutual recognition of its application is required, and as such, are not of normative nature. SDs may also be "Mandatory Technical Documents," that have a mandatory application for evaluations where the scope is covered by that of the SD. The usage of SDs of the latter class is not only mandatory, but certificates issued as a result of their application are recognized under the CCRA.

This supporting document has been developed by the _Dedicated Security Component_ iTC and is designed to be used to support the evaluations of products against the cPPs identified in section 1.1.

=== Technical Editor

Dedicated Security Component iTC

=== General Purpose

The purpose of a DSC is to provide seven security services to devices that incorporate them: Parse, Provision, Protect, Process, Prove, Purge, and Propagate. The DSC acts as a secure and separate processing area that stores and manipulates SDOs and SDEs that are isolated from the remainder of the device.

=== Field of special use

Vendors and integrators of mobile devices and other hardware devices that use DSCs.

=== Acknowledgements

== Introduction

=== Technology Area and Scope of Supporting Document

This Supporting Document (SD) is mandatory for evaluations of products that claim conformance to the collaborative Protection Profile for Dedicated Security Component.

A Dedicated Security Component (DSC), in the context of this cPP, is the combination of a hardware component and its controlling OS or firmware dedicated to the protection and safe use by the rich OS of Security Data Objects (SDOs) consisting of keys, identities, attributes, and Security Data Elements (SDEs). 

Although Evaluation Activities (EAs) are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they will also help developers prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their Target of Evaluation (TOE). The specific requirements in EAs may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security Functional Requirements (SFRs), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security Targets (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly required supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture). 

=== Structure of the Document

Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SARs). These are defined in separate sections of this SD. The EAs associated with the SFRs are considered to be interpretations of applying the appropriate SAR activity. For instance, activities associated with testing are representative of what is required by ATE_IND.1.

If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation then the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'. In rare cases, there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, but this must be agreed with the Certification Body for the evaluation. 

In general, if all EAs (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'pass'. 

In some cases, the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) work units have been interpreted to require the evaluator to perform specific EAs. In these instances, EAs will be specified in <<Evaluation Activities for SFRs>>, <<Evaluation Activities for SARs>>, and possibly <<Evaluation Activities for Optional Requirements>> and <<Evaluation Activities for Selection-Based Requirements>>. In cases where there are no CEM interpretations, the CEM activities are to be used to determine if SARs are satisfied and references to the CEM work units are identified as being the sole EAs to be performed. 

Finally, there are cases where EAs have rephrased CEM work units to provide clarity on what is required. The EAs are reworded for clarity and interpret the CEM work units such that they will result in more objective and repeatable actions by the evaluator. In these cases, the EA supplements the CEM work unit. These EAs will be specified in <<Evaluation Activities for SARs>>.

Note that certain parts of EAs may or may not be required depending on whether certain selections are made in the Security Target for the corresponding SFR. [.underline]#Underlined text# is used to represent specific selection items.

=== Test Environment Note

Many of the test EAs in this Supporting Document require the evaluator to directly exercise low-level interfaces to the DSC to manipulate it in a manner that may not be feasible with the commercially-available (production) model of the DSC and associated tools. When this is the case, the TOE developer may provide models of the DSC and associated tools which allow for the required tests to be executed by the evaluator (or as necessary, executed by the TOE developer and observed by the evaluator). 

For any tests that are executed using non-commercially-available versions of the TOE provided by the developer, the evaluator shall ensure the following:

* The test report shall document the measures the evaluator took to gain assurance that if the TOE itself is modified to allow for certain tests to be performed, the security of the TOE is not reduced in the unmodified TOE (i.e. if the TOE is modified to use a special firmware build, this should not create a situation where the modified build enforces required security functionality that the unmodified build does not).
* Any tools used to conduct the required testing shall produce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the test was successful (e.g., if a tool is designed to erase a particular key, it should also attempt to perform some operation that requires the use of that key to provide evidence that the key destruction succeeded).
* The evaluator shall ensure that the tool actually performs the intended action and does not create a contrived outcome that imitates the results of a passing test without performing the actual operation (e.g. if a tool is designed to erase a particular key and output its value as proof of this, the tool should be obtaining the actual key value and not simply returning a static result).

The test EAs for individual SFRs identify cases where developer tools may be needed to execute the test as written.

== Evaluation Activities for SFRs

The EAs presented in this section capture the actions the evaluator performs to address technology specific aspects covering specific SARs (e.g., ASE_TSS.1, ADV_FSP.1, AGD_OPE.1, and ATE_IND.1) - this is in addition to the CEM work units that are performed in <<Evaluation Activities for SARs>>. 

Regarding design descriptions (designated by the subsections labelled TSS, as well as any required supplementary material that may be treated as proprietary designated by the subsections labelled KMD), the evaluator must ensure there is specific information that satisfies the EA. For findings regarding the TSS and KMD sections, the evaluator's verdicts will be associated with the CEM work unit ASE_TSS.1-1. Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the cPP. 

For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator's verdicts will be associated with CEM work units ADV_FSP.1-7, AGD_OPE.1-4, and AGD_OPE.1-5. 

Finally, the subsection labelled Tests is where the iTC has determined that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary. While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the developer may have existing tests, as mentioned in section 1.4 above. Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated tests in lieu of executing the tests. In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer's tests are executing both in the manner declared by the developer and as mandated by the EA. The CEM work units that are associated with the EAs specified in this section are: ATE_IND.1-3, ATE_IND.1-4, ATE_IND.1-5, ATE_IND.1-6, and ATE_IND.1-7. 

=== Cryptographic Support (FCS)

==== Cryptographic Key Management (FCS_CKM)

===== FCS_CKM.1 Cryptographic Key Generation

====== TSS

The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine whether it describes any supported key generation or derivation functionality consistent with the claims made in FCS_CKM.1.1.

[conditional] If the key is generated according to an asymmetric key scheme, the evaluator shall review the TSS to determine that it describes how the functionality described by FCS_CKM.1/AKG is invoked. The evaluator uses the description of the key generation functionality in FCS_CKM.1/AKG or documentation available for the operational environment to determine that the key strength being requested is greater than or equal to 112 bits.

[conditional] If the key is generated according to a symmetric key scheme, the evaluator shall review the TSS to determine that it describes how the functionality described by FCS_CKM.1/SKG is invoked. The evaluator uses the description of the RBG functionality in FCS_RBG.1, to determine that the key size being requested is greater than or equal to the key size and mode to be used for the encryption/decryption of the data.

[conditional] If the key is formed from derivation, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes the method of derivation and that this method is consistent with FCS_CKM.5 or FCS_CKM_EXT.8, depending on the key derivation method claimed.

====== AGD

There are no guidance evaluation activities for this component.

====== Test

The evaluator shall iterate through each of the methods selected by the ST and perform all applicable tests from the selected methods.

====== KMD

The evaluator shall iterate through each of the methods selected by the ST and confirm that the KMD describes the applicable selected methods.

===== FCS_CKM.2 Cryptographic Key Distribution

====== TSS

The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine whether it describes the supported methods for key distribution functionality consistent with the selection(s) made in FCS_CKM.2.1. The evaluator shall confirm that the matching SFRs are included in the ST based on the selection(s) made in FCS_CKM.2.1.

====== AGD

The evaluator shall verify that the guidance instructs the administrator how to configure the TOE to use the selected key distribution method.

====== Test

Testing for this SFR is performed under the corresponding functions based on the selection(s) made in the ST.

====== KMD

There are no KMD evaluation activities for this component.

===== FCS_CKM.6 Cryptographic Key Destruction

====== TSS

The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it lists all relevant keys and keying material (describing the source of the data, all memory types in which the data is stored (covering storage both during and outside of a session, and both plaintext and non-plaintext forms of the data)), all relevant destruction situations (including the point in time at which the destruction occurs; e.g. factory reset or device wipe function, change of authorization data, change of DEK, completion of use of an intermediate key) and the destruction method used in each case. The evaluator shall confirm that the description of the data and storage locations is consistent with the functions carried out by the TOE (e.g. that all keys in the key chain are accounted forfootnote:[Where keys are stored encrypted or wrapped under another key then this may need to be explained in order to allow the evaluator to confirm the consistency of the description of keys with the TOE functions.]). 

The evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies any configurations or circumstances that may not conform to the key destruction requirement (see further discussion in the AGD section below). Note that reference may be made to the AGD for description of the detail of such cases where destruction may be prevented or delayed. 

Where the ST specifies the use of "a value that does not contain any sensitive data" to overwrite keys, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it describes how that pattern is obtained and used, and that this justifies the claim that the pattern does not contain any sensitive data. 

====== AGD

The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation for the TOE requires users to ensure that the TOE remains under the user's control while a session is active.

A TOE may be subject to situations that could prevent or delay data destruction in some cases. The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and that this description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS (and KMD). The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation provides guidance on situations where key destruction may be delayed at the physical layer, identifying any additional mitigation actions for the user (e.g. there might be some operation the user can invoke, or the user might be advised to retain control of the device for some particular time to maximise the probability that garbage collection will have occurred).

For example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is possible that the storage may implement wear-levelling and garbage collection. This may result in additional copies of the data that are logically inaccessible but persist physically. Where available, the TOE might then describe use of the TRIM commandfootnote:[Where TRIM is used then the TSS or guidance documentation is also expected to describe how the keys are stored such that they are not inaccessible to TRIM, (e.g. they would need not to be contained in a file less than 982 bytes which would be completely contained in the master file table).] and garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies upon their deletion (this would be explained in TSS and guidance documentation). 

====== Test

The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

Test 1 [conditional]: If the TOE supports directly examining the SDO/SDE memory, this test is applied to each key or keying material held as plaintext in volatile memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE (whether or not the plaintext value is subsequently encrypted for storage in volatile or non-volatile memory).

. Record the value of the key or keying material.
. Cause the TOE to dump the SDO/SDE memory of the TOE into a binary file.
. Search the content of the binary file created in Step #2. to locate all instances of the known key value from Step #1.
+
Note that the primary purpose of Step #3. is to demonstrate that appropriate search commands are being used for Steps #8. and #9.
. Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key from Step #1.
. Cause the TOE to destroy the key.
. Cause the TOE to stop execution but not exit.
. Cause the TOE to dump the SDO/SDE memory of the TOE into a binary file.
. Search the content of the binary file created in Step #7. for instances of the known key value from Step #1.
. Break the key value from Step #1. into an evaluator-chosen set of fragments and perform a search using each fragment. (Note that the evaluator shall first confirm with the developer how the key is normally stored, in order to choose fragment sizes that are the same or smaller than any fragmentation of the data that may be implemented by the TOE. The endianness or byte-order should also be taken into account in the search.)

Steps #1.-8. ensure that the complete key does not exist anywhere in volatile memory. If a copy is found, then the test fails.

Step #9 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in memory. If the evaluator finds a 32-or-greater-consecutive-bit fragment, then fail immediately. Otherwise, there is a chance that it is not within the context of a key (e.g., some random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test should be repeated with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is also found in this repeated run then the test fails unless the developer provides a reasonable explanation for the collision, then the evaluator may give a pass on this test.

Test 2 [conditional]: If the TOE supports directly examining the non-volatile memory, this test is applied to each key and keying material held in non-volatile memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE.

. Record the value of the key or keying material.
. Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key from Step #1.
. Search the non-volatile memory the key was stored in for instances of the known key value from Step #1.
+
Note that the primary purpose of Step #3. is to demonstrate that appropriate search commands are being used for Steps #5 and #6.
. Cause the TOE to destroy the key.
. Search the non-volatile memory in which the key was stored for instances of the known key value from Step #1. If a copy is found, then the test fails.
. Break the key value from Step #1. into an evaluator-chosen set of fragments and perform a search using each fragment. (Note that the evaluator shall first confirm with the developer how the key is normally stored, in order to choose fragment sizes that are the same or smaller than any fragmentation of the data that may be implemented by the TOE. The endianness or byte-order should also be taken into account in the search).

Step #6 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in non-volatile memory. If the evaluator finds a 32-or-greater-consecutive-bit fragment, then fail immediately. Otherwise, there is a chance that it is not within the context of a key (e.g., some random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test should be repeated with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is also found in this repeated run then the test fails unless the developer provides a reasonable explanation for the collision, then the evaluator may give a pass on this test.

Test 3 [conditional]: If the TOE the TOE supports directly examining the non-volatile memory, this test is applied to each key and keying material held in non-volatile memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE.

. Record the memory location of the key or keying material.
. Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key from Step #1.
. Cause the TOE to destroy the key. Record the value to be used for the overwrite of the key. 
. Examine the memory location from Step #1. to ensure the appropriate pattern (recorded in Step #3) is used.

The test succeeds if correct pattern is found at the memory location. If the pattern is not found, then the test fails.

Test 4 [conditional]: If the TOE does not support directly examining the SDO/SDE memory or non-volatile memory, this test is applied to each key and keying material held in volatile memory or non-volatile memory.

. Record the corresponding checksum value of the key or keying material for a given key reference.
+
The checksum value must be deterministically computed by the TOE on the entire key or keying material. Possible methods include: error detection codes, cryptographic hashes, encryption using a fixed key.
. Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key from Step #1.
. Cause the TOE to destroy the key.
. Record the corresponding checksum value of the key or keying material for the key reference from Step #1.
. Verify that the corresponding checksum values obtained from Step #1. and Step #4. are different.

The test succeeds if the corresponding checksum values are found to be different. If they are found to be identical, then the test fails.

Note that each key and keying material held in volatile or non-volatile memory must be tested using either Test 1, Test 2 and 3, or Test 4. Tests 1 through 3 are preferred and shall be performed where possible.

====== KMD

The evaluator shall examine the KMD to verify that it identifies and describes the interfaces that are used to service commands to read/write memory. The evaluator shall examine the interface description for each different media type to ensure that the interface supports the selections made by the ST author. 

The evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that all keys and keying material identified in the TSS and KMD have been accounted for. 

Note that where selections include 'destruction of reference to the key directly followed by a request for garbage collection' (for volatile memory) then the evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that it explains the nature of the destruction of the reference, the request for garbage collection, and of the garbage collection process itself.

===== FCS_CKM_EXT.7 Cryptographic Key Agreement

====== TSS

The evaluator shall ensure that the selected RSA, DH, and ECDH key agreement schemes correspond to the key generation schemes selected in FCS_CKM.1/AKG. If the ST selects DH, the TSS shall describe how the implementation meets the relevant sections of RFC 3526 (Section 3-7) or RFC 7919 (Appendices A.1-A.5). If the ST selects ECIES, the TSS shall describe the key sizes and algorithms (e.g. elliptic curve point multiplication, ECDH with either NIST or Brainpool curves, a symmetric cipher permitted by FCS_COP.1/SKC, a hash algorithm permitted by FCS_COP.1/Hash, and a MAC algorithm permitted by FCS_COP.1/KeyedHash or FCS_COP.1/CMAC) that are supported for the ECIES implementation.

The evaluator shall ensure that, for each key agreement scheme, the size of the derived keying material is at least the same as the intended strength of the key agreement scheme, and where feasible this should be twice the intended security strength of the key agreement scheme.

For each key agreement scheme, the TSS shall list the associated key derivation function if applicable.

====== AGD

The evaluator shall verify that the guidance instructs the administrator how to configure the TOE to use the selected key agreement scheme.

====== Test

The algorithm tests might require access to a development version of the TOE or a test platform that provides tools not typically found on factory products.

The developer shall provide sufficient information to the evaluator to properly define the implementation of the algorithm. The evaluator shall define at least one test group (a configuration of algorithm properties and associated test cases) for each combination of the following parameters, according to the implementation of the algorithm:

* Modulus size (KAS2)
* Domain parameters (DH)
* Curve (ECDH, ECIES)
* Key agreement role (initiator or responder)
* Hash algorithm (if applicable)
* Associated data pattern (if applicable)
* KDF configuration (if applicable)

Each test group shall consist of at least 10 test cases meeting the following requirements:

* Test cases shall be generated according to the parameter configuration of the test group.
* Each test case shall consist of an arbitrary "owner" private key, an arbitrary "peer" public key, an arbitrary associated data string (if applicable), and the corresponding shared secret or derived key.
* A representative sample of the domain of supported associated data sizes shall be tested.
* A representative sample of the domain of supported shared secret sizes shall be tested.
* A representative sample of the domain of supported derived key sizes shall be tested.

For each test case in each test group, the evaluator shall verify that the TSF generates the correct shared secret or derived key.

The evaluator shall be able to provide a rationale as to the sufficiency of the test groups and test cases in exercising the algorithm. Test cases shall be generated using a known-good implementation to ensure the correct result is produced by the TSF. The evaluator shall determine the proper known-good implementation and provide a rationale for its use for testing. Internal or external implementations are acceptable with a sufficient rationale.

The evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that the points at which symmetric key encryption and decryption occurs are described, and that the complete data path for symmetric key encryption is described. The evaluator checks that this description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS.

Assessment of the complete data path for symmetric key encryption includes confirming that the KMD describes the data flow from the device's host interface to the device's non-volatile memory storing the data, and gives information enabling the user data datapath to be distinguished from those situations in which data bypasses the data encryption engine (e.g. read-write operations to an unencrypted Master Boot Record area). The evaluator shall ensure that the documentation of the data path is detailed enough that it thoroughly describes the parts of the TOE that the data passes through (e.g. different memory types, processors and co-processors), its encryption state (i.e. encrypted or unencrypted) in each part, and any places where the data is stored. For example, any caching or buffering of the data should be identified and distinguished from the final destination in non-volatile memory (the latter represents the location from which the host will expect to retrieve the data in future).

If support for AES-CTR is claimed and the counter value source is internal to the TOE, the evaluator shall verify that the KMD describes the internal counter mechanism used to ensure that it provides unique counter block values.

* Presence of a derivation function (CTR_DRBG)
* Prediction resistance support

Each test group shall consist of at least 15 test cases meeting the following requirements:

* Test cases shall be generated according to the parameter configuration of the test group.
* Each test case shall consist of an arbitrary entropy input value, an arbitrary nonce (if supported), an arbitrary personalization string (if supported), two arbitrary additional input values (if supported), and the corresponding pseudorandom output.

There are no KMD evaluation activities for this component.

==== Cryptographic Key Storage (Extended - FCS_STG_EXT)

===== FCS_STG_EXT.1 Protected Storage

The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS contains a description of the protected storage mechanism that justifies the selection of [.underline]#mutable hardware-based# or [.underline]#software-based#.

====== AGD

The evaluator shall examine the operational guidance to ensure that it describes the process for generating keys, importing keys, or both, based on what is claimed by the ST. The evaluator shall also examine the operational guidance to ensure that it describes the process for destroying keys that have been imported or generated.

====== Test

The evaluator shall test the functionality of each security function as described below. If the TOE supports both import and generation of keys, the evaluator shall repeat the testing as needed to demonstrate that the keys resulting from both operations are treated in the same manner. The devices used with the tooling may need to be non-production devices in order to enable the execution and gathering of evidence. 

Test 1: The evaluator shall import or generate keys/secrets of each supported type according to the operational guidance. The evaluator shall write, or the developer shall provide access to, an application that generates a key/secret of each supported type and calls the import functions. The evaluator shall verify that no errors occur during import.

Test 2: The evaluator shall write, or the developer shall provide access to, an application that uses a generated or imported key/secret:

* For RSA, the secret shall be used to sign data. 
* For ECDSA, the secret shall be used to sign data.

The evaluator shall repeat this test with the application-imported or application-generated keys/secrets and a different application's imported keys/secrets or generated keys/secrets. The evaluator shall verify that the TOE requires approval before allowing the application to use the key/secret imported or generated by the user or by a different application: 

* The evaluator shall deny the approvals to verify that the application is not able to use the key/secret as described.

====== Test

This component is tested as part of FDP_ACF.1.

====== KMD

There are no KMD evaluation activities for this component.

==== Access Control Functions (FDP_ACF)

===== FDP_ACF.1 Security Attribute Based Access Control

====== TSS

The evaluator shall examine the TSS to verify that it describes the policy rules for the Access Control SFP. Specifically, the evaluator should be able to identify, for any arbitrary subject-object-operation pairing, which of the following is true:

[loweralpha]
. The subject can always perform the desired operation.
. The subject can never perform the desired operation, either because they lack sufficient permission or because the TSF includes no interface to support the operation.
. The subject can only perform the desired operation under certain conditions (which the evaluator shall verify are described in the TSS). For example, "the S.CApp subject may only perform the OP.Destroy operation on an OB.SDO object if it was the subject that originally created or imported the SDO."
. The subject can only perform the desired operation on one or more attributes of the object as opposed to the entire object itself (which the evaluator shall verify are identified in the TSS).
. Whether the subject can perform the desired operation depends on TSF configuration (which the evaluator shall verify is described in the TSS as part of the evaluation of FMT_SMF.1).
. Some combination of c, d, and e.

Given that this SFR requires a large number of potential subject-object-operation pairings to be identified, it is not the expectation that the TSS contain an exhaustive list of these pairings. It is possible that large numbers of pairings are addressed by blanket statements of policy rules, such as "the subjects S.DSC and S.CApp are never able to perform any operation on the OB.AntiReplay object." For any rules that are not addressed in this manner, the evaluator shall verify the TSS includes sufficient data for the evaluator to determine how the TSF will evaluate the action. This can be presented in the form of a table, flowchart, list, or other manner that the ST author finds suitable.

Note that the TOE developer may not use the same terminology for its subjects, objects, and operations as the PP. If this is the case, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS includes a mapping that unambiguously shows how the vendor's preferred terminology corresponds to what the PP defines.

====== AGD

For any access control policy enforcement behavior that is configurable, the evaluator shall ensure that the operational guidance describes how to perform the configuration, including any restrictions on permissible configurable settings.

====== Test

The following testing may require the TOE developer to make a test harness available to the evaluator that allows the evaluator to interface directly with the TOE. Due to the large volume of potential testing that this requires, this test may require the use of an automated script. If a test script is made available, the evaluator shall verify that it includes sufficient detail to validate the claims made in the TSS.

For each subject/object/operation/attribute combination, the evaluator shall attempt to perform the operation or determine that no interface is present to attempt the operation, consistent with the limitations described in the TSS.

For each case where an operation is always permitted or never permitted, both positive and negative testing will be conducted implicitly by attempting the operation with all possible subjects and determining that the intended results occur in each case.

For each case where the operation succeeds or fails based on the target object attribute, the evaluator shall ensure that both positive and negative testing is performed such that only the correct target attributes can be operated upon.

For each case where the operation succeeds or fails based on one or more specific conditions, the evaluator shall ensure that both positive and negative testing is performed such that the presence of the conditions causes the test to succeed while the absence of the conditions causes the test to fail.

For each case where the operation succeeds or fails based on an administratively configured setting, the evaluator shall ensure that both positive and negative testing is performed such that the configuration setting can be shown to affect whether or not the operation succeeds.

. Verify the presence of the item created in the previous step.
. Initiate the factory reset using the given external interface.
. Verify the item created in Step #1. no longer exists.

Test 2 [conditional]: If [.underline]#presentation of ...# is selected in FDP_FRS_EXT.1.1, the evaluator shall identify all functions that reset the DSC to factory settings and their respective required authorization data. For each function and for each authorization method (i.e., type of requured authorization data), the evaluator shall perform the following steps:

. Create an SDE or SDO.
. Verify the presence of the item created in the previous step.
. Initiate the factory reset using the given function and authorization data.
. Verify the item created in Step #1. no longer exists.

====== TSS

The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it describes the protection for SDEs and authorization data and the methods of protection (e.g. protected storage, symmetric encryption, key wrapping, etc.).

The evaluator shall also examine the TSS to determine whether the TSF stores this data inside the TOE boundary or in its operational environment. If the TSF stores this data inside the TOE boundary, the evaluator shall ensure that TSF uses one of the listed methods to provide confidentiality. If the data is stored in the TOE's operational environment, the evaluator shall ensure that the TSF uses key wrapping to provide confidentiality.

The evaluator shall examine the TSS to confirm it sufficiently describes each method used to provide confidentiality for SDEs. The evaluator shall also confirm that the TOE supports all encryption methods selected.

The evaluator shall perform the following tests for each method by which the TSF authorizes access the SDOs (e.g. any passwords entered as part of establishing authorization):

Test 1: If the administrator is able to configure any of the variables for authorization attempts, the evaluator shall use the operational guidance to configure the number of successive unsuccessful authorization attempts allowed by the TOE. The evaluator shall test that once the authorization attempts limit is reached (whether configured by the administrator or statically specified), authorization attempts with valid credentials are no longer successful.

Test 2: After reaching the limit for unsuccessful authorization attempts as in Test 1 above, the evaluator shall proceed as follows. If the action selected in FIA_AFL_EXT.1.3 is included in the ST then the evaluator shall confirm by testing that following the operational guidance and performing each action specified in the ST to re-enable access results in successful access. If the time period selection in FIA_AFL_EXT.1.3 is included in the ST, then the evaluator shall wait for just less than the time period configured in Test 1 and show that an authorization attempt using valid credentials does not result in successful access. The evaluator shall then wait until just after the time period configured in Test 1 and show that an authorization attempt using valid credentials results in successful access.

The evaluator shall configure the temperature of the TOE close to the approximate extreme of the normal operating range specified in the TSS and verify that the TSF continues to function as expected. This may be done via ambient temperature or induced locally as is most appropriate for the TOE (and the accessibility to the physical component). 

The evaluator shall determine 'expected functionality' based on how the TSS describes the TOE's reaction to an environmental failure. For example, if the TSS states that the TOE's response is to shut down, it can be assumed that the TOE functions as expected if it does not shut down. If the TSS states that the TOE's response is to zeroize certain data, it can be assumed that the TOE functions as expected if the evaluator performs functions that rely on known data values and obtain results that indicate non-zero values.

The evaluator shall then extend the temperature outside of the specified normal range and verify that the TOE responds in the manner specified in the ST.

The evaluator shall configure the voltage of the TOE close to the approximate extreme of the normal operating range specified in the TSS and verify that the TSF continues to function as expected. 

The evaluator shall determine 'expected functionality' based on how the TSS describes the TOE's reaction to an environmental failure. For example, if the TSS states that the TOE's response is to shut down, it can be assumed that the TOE functions as expected if it does not shut down. If the TSS states that the TOE's response is to zeroize certain data, it can be assumed that the TOE functions as expected if the evaluator performs functions that rely on known data values and obtain results that indicate non-zero values.

The evaluator shall then extend the voltage outside of the specified normal range and verify that the TOE responds in the manner specified in the ST. If the TOE's response is to zeroize known data, the evaluator shall return the voltage to a normal range, perform functions that rely on known data values, and observe that the results of these functions are consistent with known values of zero.

The evaluator shall then induce a voltage glitch outside of the specified normal range and verify that the TOE responds in the manner specified in the ST. If the TOE's response is to zeroize known data, the evaluator shall return the voltage to a normal range, perform functions that rely on known data values, and observe that the results of these functions are consistent with known values of zero.

== Evaluation Activities for SARs

The sections below specify EAs for the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) included in the related cPPs. The EAs in <<Evaluation Activities for SFRs>>, <<Evaluation Activities for Optional Requirements>>, and <<Evaluation Activities for Selection-Based Requirements>> are an interpretation of the more general CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology area of the TOE.

In this section, each SAR that is contained in the [DSC cPP] is listed, and the EAs that are not associated with an SFR are captured here, or a reference is made to the CEM, and the evaluator is expected to perform the CEM work units.

=== ASE: Security Target Evaluation
:xrefstyle: short
When evaluating a Security Target, the evaluator performs the work units as presented in the CEM. In addition, the evaluator ensures the content of the TSS in the ST satisfies the EAs specified in <<Evaluation Activities for SFRs>> as well as the EAs for the optional and selection-based SFRs claimed by the ST and specified in <<Evaluation Activities for Optional Requirements>> and <<Evaluation Activities for Selection-Based Requirements>>.

=== ADV: Development

==== Basic Functional Specification (ADV_FSP.1)
:xrefstyle: full
The EAs for this assurance component focus on understanding the interfaces (e.g., application programing interfaces, command line interfaces, graphical user interfaces, network interfaces) described in the AGD documentation, and possibly identified in the TOE Summary Specification (TSS) and Key Management Documentation (KMD) in response to the SFRs. Specific evaluator actions to be performed against this documentation are identified (where relevant) for each SFR in <<Evaluation Activities for SFRs>>, and in EAs for AGD, ATE and AVA SARs in other parts of xref:Evaluation Activities for SARs[xrefstyle=short].

The EAs presented in this section address the CEM work units ADV_FSP.1-1, ADV_FSP.1-2, ADV_FSP.1-3, and ADV_FSP.1-5.

The EAs are reworded for clarity and interpret the CEM work units such that they will result in more objective and repeatable actions by the evaluator. The EAs in this SD are intended to ensure the evaluators are consistently performing equivalent actions.

The documents to be examined for this assurance component in an evaluation are therefore the Security Target, AGD documentation, and any required supplementary information required by the [DSC cPP]: no additional "functional specification" documentation is necessary to satisfy the EAs. The interfaces that need to be evaluated are also identified by reference to the EAs listed for each SFR, and are expected to be identified in the context of the Security Target, AGD documentation, and any required supplementary information defined in the [DSC cPP] rather than as a separate list specifically for the purposes of CC evaluation. The direct identification of documentation requirements and their assessment as part of the EAs for each SFR also means that the tracing required in ADV_FSP.1.2D (work units ADV_FSP.1-4, ADV_FSP.1-6 and ADV_FSP.1-7) is treated as implicit and no separate mapping information is required for this element.

|===

|CEM ADV_FSP.1 Work Units
|Evaluation Activities

|ADV_FSP.1-1 The evaluator *_shall examine_* the functional specification to determine that it states the purpose of each SFR-supporting and SFR-enforcing TSFI. 
|<<FSPEval1>>: _The evaluator shall examine the interface documentation to ensure it describes the purpose and method of use for each TSFI that is identified as being security relevant._

|ADV_FSP.1-2 The evaluator *_shall examine_* the functional specification to determine that the method of use for each SFR-supporting and SFR-enforcing TSFI is given. 
|<<FSPEval2>>: _The evaluator shall check the interface documentation to ensure it identifies and describes the parameters for each TSFI that is identified as being security relevant._

|ADV_FSP.1-3 The evaluator *_shall examine_* the presentation of the TSFI to determine that it identifies all parameters associated with each SFR-enforcing and SFR supporting TSFI. 
|<<FSPEval3>>: _The evaluator shall examine the interface documentation to develop a mapping of the interfaces to SFRs._

|ADV_FSP.1-4 The evaluator *_shall examine_* the rationale provided by the developer for the implicit categorisation of interfaces as SFR-non-interfering to determine that it is accurate. 
|Paragraph 609 from the CEM: "In the case where the developer has provided adequate documentation to perform the analysis called for by the rest of the work units for this component without explicitly identifying SFR-enforcing and SFR-supporting interfaces, this work unit should be considered satisfied." Since the rest of the ADV_FSP.1 work units will have been satisfied upon completion of the EAs, it follows that this work unit is satisfied as well.

|ADV_FSP.1-5 The evaluator *_shall check_* that the tracing links the SFRs to the corresponding TSFIs. 
|<<FSPEval4>>: _The evaluator shall examine the interface documentation to develop a mapping of the interfaces to SFRs._

|ADV_FSP.1-6 The evaluator *_shall examine_* the functional specification to determine that it is a complete instantiation of the SFRs. 
|EAs that are associated with the SFRs in xref:Evaluation Activities for SFRs[xrefstyle=short], and, if applicable, xref:Evaluation Activities for Optional Requirements[xrefstyle=short] and xref:Evaluation Activities for Selection-Based Requirements[xrefstyle=short], are performed to ensure that all the SFRs where the security functionality is externally visible (i.e., at the TSFI) are covered. Therefore, the intent of this work unit is covered.

|ADV_FSP.1-7 The evaluator *_shall examine_* the functional specification to determine that it is an accurate instantiation of the SFRs. 
|EAs that are associated with the SFRs in xref:Evaluation Activities for SFRs[xrefstyle=short], and, if applicable, xref:Evaluation Activities for Optional Requirements[xrefstyle=short] and xref:Evaluation Activities for Selection-Based Requirements[xrefstyle=short], are performed to ensure that all the SFRs where the security functionality is externally visible (i.e., at the TSFI) are addressed, and that the description of the interfaces is accurate with respect to the specification captured in the SFRs. Therefore, the intent of this work unit is covered.

|===

[[FSPEval1]]
===== Evaluation Activity 

_The evaluator shall examine the interface documentation to ensure it describes the purpose and_ method _of use for each TSFI that is identified as being security relevant._

In this context, TSFI are deemed security relevant if they are used by the administrator to configure the TOE, or if they are used by the TSF to send or receive security-relevant data or to invoke an API or other service that supports the execution of a security function. The intent is that these interfaces will be adequately tested, and having an understanding of how these interfaces are used in the TOE is necessary to ensure proper test coverage is applied.

The set of TSFI that are provided as evaluation evidence are contained in the operational guidance. 

[[FSPEval2]]
===== Evaluation Activity

_The evaluator shall check the interface documentation to ensure it identifies and describes the parameters for each TSFI that is identified as being security relevant._

[[FSPEval3]]
===== Evaluation Activity

_The evaluator shall examine the interface documentation to develop a mapping of the interfaces to SFRs._

The evaluator uses the provided documentation and first identifies, and then examines a representative set of interfaces to perform the EAs presented in <<Evaluation Activities for SFRs>>, including the EAs associated with testing of the interfaces.

It should be noted that there may be some SFRs that do not have an interface that is explicitly "mapped" to invoke the desired functionality. For example, generating a random bit string, destroying a cryptographic key that is no longer needed, or the TSF failing to a secure state, are capabilities that may be specified in SFRs, but are not invoked by an interface and are performed entirely within the TOE boundary. 

However, if the evaluator is unable to perform some other required EA because there is insufficient design and interface information, then the evaluator is entitled to conclude that an adequate functional specification has not been provided, and hence that the verdict for the ADV_FSP.1 assurance component is a 'fail'.

<<MaptoSFRs>> below lists all potentially exportable DSC services supported by this [DSC cPP] along with the SFRs that implement the services. The ST author should include this table in the ST after removing the rows for services not supported by the DSC or whose interfaces are not available to dependent components. SFRs surrounded in brackets ("[SFR]") are optional or selection-based. All the SFRs listed in the resulting table must be selected in the ST.

|===

The ST must include a description of the interface for each exported service. Interface descriptions must include the purpose of the interface, method of use, parameters, and parameter descriptions. The descriptions must provide sufficient detail to allow the ST author of a composite evaluation to align the DSC interfaces with the dependent component SFRs that they satisfy. Multiple DSC operations may be combined to satisfy dependent component SFRs. 

:xrefstyle: short
It is not required that a DSC expose interfaces to all the <<Mapping between DSC Exportable Services and SFRs>> services to a dependent component. Nor is a DSC limited to providing only the above services. But all such services that are provided must be documented and the interfaces described.

:xrefstyle: full

=== AGD: Guidance Documents

It is not necessary for a TOE to provide separate documentation to meet the individual requirements of AGD_OPE and AGD_PRE. Although the EAs in this section are described under the traditionally separate AGD families, the mapping between the documentation provided by the developer and the AGD_OPE and AGD_PRE requirements may be many-to-many, as long as all requirements are met in documentation that is delivered to administrators and users (as appropriate) as part of the TOE. 

Note that a DSC is not a direct-to-consumer product and is more typically integrated with a larger system that is distributed to end customers. The guidance documentation may reflect this. For example, information on how to administer the TOE may not necessarily be user-facing instructions; rather, they may be presented as APIs or other information that could be used by a third-party integrator to develop user-facing functions that interface with the DSC to perform the required behavior.

Note that unique aspects of the DSC's design or architecture may mean that some of these EAs below are not applicable to the TOE because they may be enforced by default. If a given EA is not applicable, the evaluator shall ensure that adequate rationale is provided to justify the lack of applicability.

==== Operational User Guidance (AGD_OPE.1)

The evaluator performs the CEM work units associated with the AGD_OPE.1 SAR. Specific requirements and EAs on the guidance documentation are identified (where relevant) in the individual EAs for each SFR. 

In addition, the evaluator performs the EAs specified below.

===== Evaluation Activity

_The evaluator shall ensure the Operational guidance documentation is distributed to administrators and users (as appropriate) as part of the TOE, so that_ there _is a reasonable guarantee that administrators and users are aware of the existence and role of the documentation in establishing and maintaining the evaluated configuration._ 

===== Evaluation Activity

_The evaluator shall ensure that the Operational guidance is provided for every Operational Environment that the product supports as claimed in the Security Target and shall adequately address all platforms claimed for the TOE in the Security Target._

===== Evaluation Activity

_The_ evaluator _shall ensure that the Operational guidance contains instructions for configuring any cryptographic engine associated with the evaluated configuration of the TOE. It shall provide a warning to the administrator that use of other cryptographic engines was not evaluated nor tested during the CC evaluation of the TOE._

===== Evaluation Activity

_The evaluator shall ensure the Operational guidance makes it clear to an administrator which security functionality and interfaces have been assessed and tested by the EAs._

==== Preparative Procedures (AGD_PRE.1)

The evaluator performs the CEM work units associated with the AGD_PRE.1 SAR. Specific requirements and EAs on the preparative documentation are identified (and where relevant are captured in the Guidance Documentation portions of the EAs) in the individual EAs for each SFR. 

Preparative procedures are distributed to administrators and users (as appropriate) as part of the TOE, so that there is a reasonable guarantee that administrators and users are aware of the existence and role of the documentation in establishing and maintaining the evaluated configuration.

In addition, the evaluator performs the EAs specified below. Note that unique aspects of the DSC's design or architecture may mean that some of these EAs are not applicable to the TOE because they may be enforced by default. If a given EA is not applicable, the evaluator shall ensure that adequate rationale is provided to justify the lack of applicability.

===== Evaluation Activity

_The_ evaluator _shall examine the preparative procedures to ensure they include a description of how the administrator verifies that the operational environment can fulfil its role to support the security functionality (including the requirements of the Security Objectives for the Operational Environment specified in the Security Target)._ 

The documentation should be in an informal style and should be written with sufficient detail and explanation that they can be understood and used by the target audience (which will typically include product developers/engineers that are responsible for integrating the DSC into a larger system).

===== Evaluation Activity

_The evaluator shall examine the preparative procedures to ensure they are provided for every Operational Environment that the product supports as claimed in the Security Target and shall adequately address all platforms claimed for the TOE in the Security Target._

===== Evaluation Activity

_The evaluator shall examine the preparative procedures to ensure they include instructions to successfully install the TSF in each Operational Environment._

===== Evaluation Activity

_The evaluator shall examine the preparative procedures to ensure they include instructions to manage the security of the TSF as a product and as a component of the larger operational environment._

=== ALC: Life-cycle Support

==== Labelling of the TOE (ALC_CMC.1)

When evaluating that the TOE has been provided and is labelled with a unique reference, the evaluator performs the work units as presented in the CEM.

==== TOE CM coverage (ALC_CMS.1)

When evaluating the developer's coverage of the TOE in their CM system, the evaluator performs the work units as presented in the CEM.

==== Basic Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR.1) (optional)

When evaluating the developer's procedures regarding basic flaw remediation, the evaluator performs the work units as presented in the CEM.

==== Flaw Reporting Procedures (ALC_FLR.2) (optional)

When evaluating the developer's flaw reporting procedures, the evaluator performs the work units as presented in the CEM.

==== Systematic Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR.3) (optional)

When evaluating the developer's procedures regarding systematic flaw remediation, the evaluator performs the work units as presented in the CEM.

=== ATE: Tests

==== Independent Testing - Conformance (ATE_IND.1)

The focus of the testing is to confirm that the requirements specified in the SFRs are being met. Testing is performed to confirm the functionality, as described in the AGD (operational guidance), TSS and KMD (as specified for the functional specification), is accurate.

The evaluator performs the CEM work units associated with the ATE_IND.1 SAR. Specific testing requirements and EAs are captured for each SFR in <<Evaluation Activities for SFRs>>, <<Evaluation Activities for Optional Requirements>> and <<Evaluation Activities for Selection-Based Requirements>>. 

=== AVA: Vulnerability Assessment

==== Vulnerability Survey (AVA_VAN.1)

While vulnerability analysis is inherently a subjective activity, a minimum level of analysis can be defined and some measure of objectivity and repeatability (or at least comparability) can be imposed on the vulnerability analysis process. In order to achieve such objectivity and repeatability it is important that the evaluator follows a set of well-defined activities, and documents their findings so others can follow their arguments and come to the same conclusions as the evaluator. While this does not guarantee that different evaluation facilities will identify exactly the same type of vulnerabilities or come to exactly the same conclusions, the approach defines the minimum level of analysis and the scope of that analysis, and provides Certification Bodies a measure of assurance that the minimum level of analysis is being performed by the evaluation facilities.

In order to meet these goals some refinement of the AVA_VAN.1 CEM work units is needed. As <<MaptoAVA>> indicates, for each work unit in AVA_VAN.1, whether the CEM work unit is to be performed as written, or if it has been clarified by an Evaluation Activity. If clarification has been provided, a reference to this clarification is provided in the table.

Because of the level of detail required for the evaluation activities, the bulk of the instructions are contained in Appendix A, while an "outline" of the evaluation activity is provided below.

[[EADocs]]
===== Evaluation Activity (Documentation): 

The developer shall provide documentation identifying the list of software and hardware components that compose the TOE. Hardware components apply to all systems claimed in the ST, and should identify at a minimum the processors used by the TOE. Software components include any libraries used by the TOE, such as cryptographic libraries. This additional documentation is merely a list of the name and version number of the components, and will be used by the evaluators in formulating hypotheses during their analysis. 

The evaluator shall examine the documentation outlined below provided by the vendor to confirm that it contains all required information. This documentation is in addition to the documentation already required to be supplied in response to the EAs listed previously.

In addition to the activities specified by the CEM in accordance with <<MaptoAVA>> above, the evaluator shall perform the following activities.

===== Evaluation Activity
:xrefstyle: short
_The evaluator formulates hypotheses in accordance with process defined in <<Sources of vulnerability information>>. The evaluator documents the flaw hypotheses generated for the TOE in the report in accordance with the guidelines in <<Reporting>>. The_ evaluator _shall perform vulnerability analysis in accordance with <<Process for Evaluator Vulnerability Analysis>>. The results of the analysis shall be documented in the report according to <<Reporting>>._

== Required Supplementary Information

This Supporting Document refers in various places to the possibility that 'required supplementary information' may need to be supplied as part of the deliverables for an evaluation. This term is intended to describe information that is not necessarily included in the Security Target or operational guidance, and that may not necessarily be public. Examples of such information could be entropy analysis, or description of a cryptographic key management architecture used in (or in support of) the TOE. The requirement for any such supplementary information will be identified in the relevant cPP. 

The supplementary information required by this SD are:

* Entropy Documentation, which is evaluated against the guidance specified in Appendix D of the [DSC cPP].
* A Key Management Document (KMD), which is evaluated against all relevant KMD Evaluation Activities in this SD.

[appendix]
== Vulnerability Analysis

=== Sources of vulnerability information

CEM work unit AVA_VAN.1-3 has been supplemented in this Supporting Document to provide a better-defined set of flaws to investigate and procedures to follow based on this particular technology. Terminology used is based on the flaw hypothesis methodology, where the evaluation team hypothesizes flaws and then either proves or disproves those flaws (a flaw is equivalent to a "potential vulnerability" as used in the CEM). Flaws are categorized into four "types" depending on how they are formulated:

. A list of flaw hypotheses applicable to the technology described by the [DSC cPP] derived from public sources as documented in <<Type 1 Hypotheses—Public-Vulnerability-based>>—this fixed set has been agreed to by the iTC. Additionally, this will be supplemented with entries for a set of public sources (as indicated below) that are directly applicable to the TOE or its identified components (as defined by the process in <<Type 1 Hypotheses—Public-Vulnerability-based>> below); this is to ensure that the evaluators include in their assessment applicable entries that have been discovered since the [DSC cPP] was published;
. A list of flaw hypotheses contained in this document that are derived from lessons learned specific to that technology and other iTC input (that might be derived from other open sources and vulnerability databases, for example) as documented in <<Type 2 Hypotheses—iTC-Sourced>>; 
. A list of flaw hypotheses derived from information available to the evaluators; this includes the baseline evidence provided by the vendor described in this Supporting Document (documentation associated with EAs, documentation described in <<EADocs>>, documentation described in <<Required Supplementary Information>>), as well as other information (public or based on evaluator experience) as documented in <<Type 3 Hypotheses—Evaluation-Team-Generated>>; and
. A list of flaw hypotheses that are generated through the use of iTC-defined tools (e.g. network mappping utilities, protocol testers) and their application is specified in <<Type 4 Hypotheses—Tool-Generated>>.

==== Type 1 Hypotheses—Public-Vulnerability-based

The following list of public sources of vulnerability information were selected by the iTC (in no particular order):
[loweralpha]
. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures: https://cve.mitre.org/cve/[https://cve.mitre.org/cve/]
. The National Vulnerability Database: https://nvd.nist.gov/[https://nvd.nist.gov/]
. US-CERT https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/search/[https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/search/]
. CVE Details: https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-search.php[https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-search.php]
. Tipping Point Zero Day Initiative https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories[https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories]
. Offensive Security Exploit Database: https://www.exploit-db.com/[https://www.exploit-db.com/]

The list of sources above should be searched with the following search terms:

* Vendor name
* Product name
* Third-party or OEM components, if known
* If the DSC is embedded in specific commercially-available products, any terms relevant to a sample of those products

In order to successfully complete this activity, the evaluator will use the developer provided list of all of 3rd party library information that is used as part of their product, along with the version and any other identifying information (this is required in the [DSC cPP] as part of the ASE_TSS.1.1C requirement). This applies to hardware (including chipsets, etc.) that a vendor uses as part of their TOE. This TOE-unique information will be used in the search terms the evaluator uses in addition to those listed above.

The evaluator will also consider the requirements that are chosen and the appropriate guidance that is tied to each requirement.

In order to supplement this list, the evaluators shall also perform a search on the sources listed above to determine a list of potential flaw hypotheses that are more recent that the publication date of the [DSC cPP], and those that are specific to the TOE and its components as specified by the additional documentation mentioned above. Any duplicates - either in a specific entry, or in the flaw hypothesis that is generated from an entry from the same or a different source - can be noted and removed from consideration by the evaluation team. 

As part of type 1 flaw hypothesis generation for the specific components of the TOE, the evaluator shall also search the component manufacturer's websites to determine if flaw hypotheses can be generated on this basis (for instance, if security patches have been released for the version of the component being evaluated, the subject of those patches may form the basis for a flaw hypothesis).

==== Type 2 Hypotheses—iTC-Sourced

The following list of flaw hypothesis generated by the iTC for this technology must be considered by the evaluation team as flaw hypotheses in performing the vulnerability assessment. 

There are currently no iTC-sourced flaw hypotheses. A future revision of the [DSC cPP] may update this section for relevant findings made by evaluation laboratories.

If the evaluators discover a Type 3 or Type 4 flaw that they believe should be considered as a Type 2 flaw in future versions of this [DSC cPP], they should work with their Certification Body to determine the appropriate means of submitting the flaw for consideration by the iTC.

==== Type 3 Hypotheses—Evaluation-Team-Generated

The iTC has leveraged the expertise of the developers and the evaluation labs to diligently develop the appropriate search terms and vulnerability databases. They have also thoughtfully considered the iTC-sourced hypotheses the evaluators should use based upon the applicable use case and the threats to be mitigated by the SFRs. Therefore, it is the intent of the iTC, for the evaluation to focus all effort on the Type 1 and Type 2 Hypotheses and has decided that Type 3 Hypotheses are not necessary.

However, if the evaluators discover a Type 3 potential flaw that they believe should be considered, they should work with their Certification Body to determine the feasibility of pursuing the hypothesis. The Certification Body may determine whether the potential flaw hypotheses is worth submitting to the iTC for consideration as Type 2 hypotheses in future drafts of the [DSC cPP]/SD.

==== Type 4 Hypotheses—Tool-Generated

The iTC has called out several tools that should be used during the Type 2 hypotheses process. Therefore, the use of any tools is covered within the Type 2 construct and the iTC does not see any additional tools that are necessary. The use case for Version 2 of this [DSC cPP] is rather straightforward - the device is found in a powered down state and has not been subjected to revisit/evil maid attacks. Since the use case is so narrow, and is not a typical model for penetration or fuzzing testing, the normal types of testing do not apply. Therefore, the relevant types of tools are referenced in Type 2.

=== Process for Evaluator Vulnerability Analysis

As flaw hypotheses are generated from the activities described above, the evaluation team will disposition them; that is, attempt to prove, disprove, or determine the non-applicability of the hypotheses. This process is as follows.

The evaluator shall refine each flaw hypothesis for the TOE and attempt to disprove it using the information provided by the developer or through penetration testing. During this process, the evaluator is free to interact directly with the developer to determine if the flaw exists, including requests to the developer for additional evidence (e.g., detailed design information, consultation with engineering staff); however, the CB should be included in these discussions. Should the developer object to the information being requested as being not compatible with the overall level of the evaluation activity/[DSC cPP] and cannot provide evidence otherwise that the flaw is disproved, the evaluator prepares an appropriate set of materials as follows: 

. The source documents used in formulating the hypothesis, and why it represents a potential compromise against a specific TOE function; 
. An argument why the flaw hypothesis could not be proven or disproved by the evidence provided so far; and
. The type of information required to investigate the flaw hypothesis further. 

The Certification Body (CB) will then either approve or disapprove the request for additional information. If approved, the developer provides the requested evidence to disprove the flaw hypothesis (or, of course, acknowledge the flaw). 

For each hypothesis, the evaluator shall note whether the flaw hypothesis has been successfully disproved, successfully proven to have identified a flaw, or requires further investigation. It is important to have the results documented as outlined in <<Reporting>> below.

If the evaluator finds a flaw, the evaluator must report these flaws to the developer. All reported flaws must be addressed as follows:

If the developer confirms that the flaw exists and that it is exploitable at Basic Attack Potential, then a change is made by the developer, and the resulting resolution is agreed by the evaluator and noted as part of the evaluation report. 

If the developer, the evaluator, and the CB agree that the flaw is exploitable only above Basic Attack Potential and does not require resolution for any other reason, then no change is made and the flaw is noted as a residual vulnerability in the CB-internal report (ETR). 

If the developer and evaluator agree that the flaw is exploitable only above Basic Attack Potential, but it is deemed critical to fix because of specific aspects such as typical use cases or operational environments, then a change is made by the developer, and the resulting resolution is agreed by the evaluator and noted as part of the evaluation report.

Disagreements between evaluator and vendor regarding questions of the existence of a flaw, its attack potential, or whether it should be deemed critical to fix are resolved by the CB.

Any testing performed by the evaluator shall be documented in the test report as outlined in <<Reporting>> below. 

As indicated in <<Reporting>>, the public statement with respect to vulnerability analysis that is performed on TOEs conformant to the [DSC cPP] is constrained to coverage of flaws associated with Types 1 and 2 (defined in <<Sources of vulnerability information>>) flaw hypotheses only. The fact that the iTC generates these candidate hypotheses indicates these must be addressed.

=== Reporting

The evaluators shall produce two reports on the testing effort; one that is public-facing (that is, included in the non-proprietary evaluation report, which is a subset of the Evaluation Technical Report (ETR)), and the complete ETR that is delivered to the overseeing CB.

The public-facing report contains:

* The flaw identifiers returned when the procedures for searching public sources were followed according to instructions in the Supporting Document per <<Type 1 Hypotheses—Public-Vulnerability-based>>;
* A statement that the evaluators have examined the Type 1 flaw hypotheses specified in this Supporting Document in <<Type 1 Hypotheses—Public-Vulnerability-based>> (i.e. the flaws listed in the previous bullet) and the Type 2 flaw hypotheses specified in this Supporting Document by the iTC in <<Type 2 Hypotheses—iTC-Sourced>>.

No other information is provided in the public-facing report.

The internal CB report contains, in addition to the information in the public-facing report:

* A list of all of the flaw hypotheses generated (cf. AVA_VAN.1-4); 
* The evaluator penetration testing effort, outlining the testing approach, configuration, depth and results (cf. AVA_VAN.1-9);
* All documentation used to generate the flaw hypotheses: 
** The documentation shall be characterized so that a reader can determine whether it is strictly required by this Supporting Document, and the nature of the documentation (design information, developer engineering notebooks, etc.);
* The evaluator shall report all exploitable vulnerabilities and residual vulnerabilities, detailing for each:
** Its source (e.g. CEM activity being undertaken when it was conceived, known to the evaluator, read in a publication);
** The SFRs not met;
* A description;
** Whether it is exploitable in its operational environment or not (i.e. exploitable or residual).
** The amount of time, level of expertise, level of knowledge of the TOE, level of opportunity and the equipment required to perform the identified vulnerabilities (cf. AVA_VAN.1-11);
** How each flaw hypothesis was resolved (this includes whether the original flaw hypothesis was confirmed or disproved, and any analysis relating to whether a residual vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker with Basic Attack Potential) (cf. AVA_VAN1-10); and 
** In the case that actual testing was performed in the investigation (either as part of flaw hypothesis generation using tools specified by the iTC in <<Type 4 Hypotheses—Tool-Generated>>, or in proving/disproving a particular flaw) the steps followed in setting up the TOE (and any required test equipment); executing the test; post-test procedures; and the actual results (to a level of detail that allow repetition of the test, including the following:

*** Identification of the potential vulnerability the TOE is being tested for;
*** Instructions to connect and setup all required test equipment as required to conduct the penetration test;
*** Instructions to establish all penetration test prerequisite initial conditions;
*** Instructions to stimulate the TSF;
*** Instructions for observing the behaviour of the TSF;
*** Descriptions of all expected results and the necessary analysis to be performed on the observed behaviour for comparison against expected results;
*** Instructions to conclude the test and establish the necessary post-test state for the TOE. (cf. AVA_VAN.1-6, AVA_VAN.1-8).

[appendix]
== Equivalency Considerations 
=== Introduction

This appendix provides a foundation for evaluators to determine whether a vendor's request for equivalency of products is allowed. 

For the purpose of this evaluation, equivalency can be broken into two categories:

* *Variations in models*: Separate TOE models/variations may include differences that could necessitate separate testing across each model. If there are no variations in any of the categories listed below, the models may be considered equivalent.
* *Variations in TOE dependencies on the environment (e.g., OS/platform the product is tested on):* The method a TOE provides functionality (or the functionality itself) may vary depending upon the environment on which it is installed. If there is no difference in the TOE-provided functionality or in the manner in which the TOE provides the functionality, the models may be considered equivalent.

Determination of equivalency for each of the above specified categories can result in several different testing outcomes. 

If a set of TOE are determined to be equivalent, testing may be performed on a single variation of the TOE. However, if the TOE variations have security-relevant functional differences, each of the TOE models that exhibits either functional or structural differences must be separately tested. Generally speaking, only the difference between each variation of TOE must be separately tested. Other equivalent functionality may be tested on a representative model and not across multiple platforms.

If it is determined that a TOE operates the same regardless of the environment, testing may be performed on a single instance for all equivalent configurations. However, if the TOE is determined to provide environment-specific functionality, testing must take place in each environment for which a difference in functionality exists. Similar to the above scenario, only the functionality affected by environment differences must be retested.

If a vendor disagrees with the evaluator's assessment of equivalency, the Scheme arbitrates between the two parties whether equivalency exists.

=== Evaluator guidance for determining equivalence

==== Strategy

When performing the equivalency analysis, the evaluator should consider each factor independently. A factor may be any number of things at various levels of abstraction, ranging from the processor a device uses, to the underlying operating system and hardware platform a software application relies upon. Examples may be the various chip sets employed by the product, the type of network interface (different device drivers), storage media (solid state drive, spinning disk, EEPROM). It is important to consider how the difference in these factors may influence the TOE's ability to enforce the SFRs. Each analysis of an individual factor will result in one of two outcomes: 

* For the particular factor, all variations of the TOE on all supported platforms are equivalent. In this case, testing may be performed on a single model in a single test environment and cover all supported models and environments.
* For the particular factor, a subset of the product has been identified to require separate testing to ensure that it operates identically to all other equivalent TOEs. The analysis would identify the specific combinations of models/testing environments that needed to be tested.

Complete CC testing of the product would encompass the totality of each individual analysis performed for each of the identified factors.

=== Test presentation/Truth in advertising

In addition to determining what to test, the evaluation results and resulting validation report must identify the actual module and testing environment combinations that have been tested. The analysis used to determine the testing subset may be considered proprietary and will only optionally be publicly included.
