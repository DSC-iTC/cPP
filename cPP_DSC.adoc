== Preface

=== Objectives of Document

This document presents the Common Criteria (CC) collaborative Protection Profile (cPP) to express the Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) and Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) for a Dedicated Security Component (DSC). The Evaluation Activities that specify the actions an evaluator performs to determine if a product satisfies the SFRs and SARs captured within this cPP are described in the Evaluation Activities for Dedicated Security Component cPP Supporting Document [SD].

The DSC international Technical Community (iTC) designed the DSC cPP as a standalone PP so that vendors may evaluate a DSC once and re-use this evidence across multiple devices that contain identical DSCs. Vendors may also combine this cPP with a platform solution cPP for CC consumers.

=== Scope of Document

The scope of the cPP within the development and evaluation process is described in the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation [CC]. In particular, a cPP defines the IT security requirements of a generic type of Target of Evaluation (TOE) and specifies the functional and assurance security measures that the ITSEF must apply to the TOE to demonstrate that it meets the cPP's stated requirements [CC1, Section C.1].

=== Intended Readership

The target audiences of this cPP are developers, CC consumers, system integrators, evaluators, and schemes.

=== TOE Overview

The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is a Dedicated Security Component (DSC). In the context of this cPP, a DSC is the combination of a hardware component and its controlling firmware. The firmware should be dedicated to providing the encompassing platform with services for the provisioning, protection, and use of Security Data Objects (SDOs), which include keys, identities, attributes, and other types of Security Data Elements (SDEs). See <<RepofTOE>> for an example of a TOE representation.

.Representation of the Target of Evaluation (TOE)
[[RepofTOE]]
image::representationofTOE.png[]

The TOE should be one or more discrete and embedded hardware components that provide well-scoped security functions that are physically inaccessible directly from the rich operating system. The DSC TOE would consist of isolated firmware and circuitry capable of executing well-defined commands against SDEs/SDOs in memory and across restricted interfaces. The DSC TOE is not intended to be a discrete, separate stand-alone component, but one which is directly embedded into a larger system.

A DSC may be comprised of a single embedded component within a device, such as a Secure Enclave Processor (SEP), while in other cases it may be a multi-component system comprised of a software layer and several hardware components (which may be discrete or embedded), such as a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Other configurations are possible, with the key point being the DSC is embedded within a larger system and is not a discrete component. These dedicated hardware/software components are integrated into a System on Chip (SoC) and as such are isolated components of a larger physical package. <<ExofTOEInt>> below shows a block diagram of a typical example of a DSC TOE with all of its internal components.

.Example of TOE Internal Components

==== Security Data Objects

.Composition of an SDO
[[SDOcomposition]]
image::SDOcomposition.png[]

An SDO is created by combining SDEs with some attributes. Each SDE used to create the SDO reaches the DSC in one of the following ways:

* By parsing SDEs received via secure channels (see O.PARSE_PROTECTION). 
* By generating the SDEs locally on the DSC as part of the Provisioning service. 

An SDO may include one or more SDEs from one or both of these sources. In the Provisioning step, the relevant SDEs are then bound together with a set of attributes resulting in an SDO. Explicit binding occurs when the DSC includes one or more SDEs along with their attributes in a formatted structure to form the SDO. An X.509 certificate is just one example of an SDO (where the signature in the certificate provides the binding of the attributes contained). A DSC protects the integrity of an SDO with one of the following methods:

* Hash or keyed hash (FCS_COP.1/Hash, FCS_COP.1/KeyedHash)
* Digital signature (FCS_COP.1/SigGen, FCS_COP.1/SigVer)

Explicit binding may also occur when the DSC wraps an SDO prior to storing it externally. <<SDOcomposition>> shows an example SDO with binding data used to secure an arbitrary number of SDEs.

Implicit binding may occur by virtue of the location of SDEs within the DSC. An implicit binding may occur for pre-installed SDEs, in which case the DSC restricts the functionality it allows with the SDEs. It may also occur when the contents of certain protected storage locations carry with them implicit attributes simply by existing in these locations.

Vendors may pre-install keys and other material in the DSC during the manufacturing process, or the DSC may automatically generate keys or other material upon first boot. Since the user (an administrator or client application acting on behalf of a human user) provides no input to these items, the cPP calls these pre-installed SDEs. Pre-installed SDEs have two distinguishing characteristics:

* These keys may persist over a factory reset; and 
* They may not be accessible to administrators. 

If the SDOs have been erased (e.g. due to a tamper response), then a factory reset may not be possible. Following an initial boot (e.g. first boot by end-user, or following a factory reset), a DSC may generate SDEs unique to an instance of a DSC that are persisted across user sessions. These are considered to be pre-installed SDEs.

Pre-installed SDOs (i.e., SDEs with implicit binding installed by the vendor at manufacturing time) are typically not accessible by non-administrative users of the platform (i.e., client applications) and are reserved for use by the DSC itself to manage its sub-components, keys, and, indirectly, user content. Pre-installed SDOs typically have implicitly bound attributes. Since pre-installed SDOs rarely, if ever, leave the DSC, they may have no formal structure containing attributes. That does not mean these attributes do not exist; only that there exists no structure in which one would find them all in one place.

The DSC may allow the modification of attributes for pre-installed SDOs. One example would be the authorization value necessary to use the SDO. Obviously, the vendor may have a strong desire to keep the users of the DSC from changing the SDE itself, or deleting it. They could allow administrators to hide the SDO, but not delete it for the sake of factory resets.

Another case of implicit binding occurs when a DSC reserves a bank of user-accessible registers with common attributes. The bank contains one or more registers, usually all of the same size. Again, the functionality within the firmware determines the attributes especially when the function applies only to one or more members of the bank of reserved registers. Without the benefit of a structure with explicit attributes, the DSC relies on the firmware to enforce the policies inherent to the attributes associated with a bank of registers; for example, the DSC firmware implicitly binds the common attributes to the bank of registers.

An SDO held in the DSC may be exported (propagated) only if it is either in a wrapped form (i.e. with confidentiality and integrity of the SDO protected by a cryptographic key-based operation), or if it is transmitted over a secure channel (protecting confidentiality, integrity and optionally authenticity of the receiving endpoint).

==== Services
.Services Provided by the TOE

The labels in Figure 4 refer to the following:

* SDE: Security Data Element
* SDO: Security Data Object (component from SDEs and attributes)
* SDO ID: Unique identifier for an SDO
* SDO1: SDO that is modified or is a reference to original SDO
* SDO2: SDO that is bound to the DSC but stored outside of it

DSCs provide seven core security services to a platform as illustrated in <<Core Security Services>>.

.Core Security Services
[[CoreSecurityServices]]
[cols="1,5",options=header]

|Service
|Description

|Parse
|The DSC shall ingest pre-provisioned keys, credentials, tokens, attributes, etc. from trusted components or services external to its boundary either across a secured channel or in a manner that the objects are protected for use only by the DSC.

|Provision
|The DSC shall create SDOs from parsed or generated SDEs and attributes using binding mechanisms to apply integrity protection to the SDEs together with their attributes.

|Protect
|The DSC shall manage protected storage for all SDOs. DSCs may implement local storage internal to the DSC boundary or utlilize external storage outside the DSC boundary. A DSC shall maintain the integrity and confidentiality (if required) of SDOs stored both inside and outside the boundary.

|Process
|The DSC shall modify and use SDOs or their attributes on behalf of authorized entities. The Process service shall coordinate with the Protect service for storage of the SDOs while not in use and shall collaborate with the Prove service to authenticate the requesting entity and validate their authorization for access to the SDO in the requested mode. The Process service shall submit an SDO to the Purge service when it is no longer needed by the platform.

|Prove
|The DSC may attest to a remote entity that the DSC is currently in a specific state. During this process, the DSC shall use the appropriate attributes or authentication tokens (such as nonces, digital signatures, etc.) to enable the remote entity to verify the authenticity of the source of the evidence.

|Purge
|When the platform no longer needs an SDO, the DSC shall execute a mechanism for destroying the SDO by permanently removing it from the DSC to protect against unauthorized recovery.

|Propagate
|If an SDO is required by or allowed to be used by a remote peer, the DSC shall ensure that the SDO is exported only as a protected object or is transmitted over a trusted channel.

|===

==== Roots of Trust

This collaborative Protection Profile (cPP) assumes a DSC will contain one Root of Trust (RoT) that is comprised of the compute engine, one set of firmware code, and pre-installed SDOs, including a unique identity bound to the hardware. The firmware code may be immutable, or it may be mutable but with controlled, authenticated, and authorized updates allowed. This code may provide one or more RoT services, such as a RoT for Measurement, Verification, or Reporting. The unique identity bound to the hardware should be immutable and third parties should be able to authenticate the manufacturer of the Root of Trust through its unique identity (e.g., the unique identity may be a credential signed by the manufacturer).

==== DSC Characteristics

The security functional requirements rely on the following characteristics of the DSC:

* Users
* Subjects
* Objects
* Security Attributes
* Operations

Users: The entities using the DSC will be client applications on the platform. They may be acting as proxies for users or may have identities of their own. The DSC will not be able to distinguish the difference; therefore, the cPP will recognize an entity known as the Client Application (CA), as the user presenting authentication tokens and authorization values (collectively known as authorization data) to the DSC for the purposes of identity verification and authorization to perform operations. <<Roles>> discusses the concept of users in more detail. This cPP also recognizes a special user called the administrator, which typically has access to DSC objects normally denied to CAs (see definition of objects below).

Subjects: The following list contains the fundamental actors in the expected operational use cases of the DSC. The first three are active actors, while the fourth is usually passive but could be active.

* S.DSC - DSC with security attribute DSC.ID, which is the identity of the DSC
* S.Admin - Admin (an authorized administrator with special privileges) security attribute Admin.ID - See <<Roles>> for more discussion on Admin.
* S.CA - CA (i.e. an authorized user or an application with a verifiable identity) with security attribute CA.ID - See <<Roles>> for more discussion on users.
* S.EPS - External Platform Storage (EPS) (e.g. transient SDE/SDO source and destination, in the case of data imported and exported for the sole use inside the DSC). In the case of a passive EPS, the DSC will properly protect the integrity and confidentiality of the objects it stores and retrieves from there. In the case of an active EPS with security attribute EPS.ID, the DSC and EPS may choose to create a secure channel through which they will pass objects back and forth.

Objects: The following list contains objects the DSC expects to use during the expected operational use cases.

* OB.P_SDO - Pre-provisioned SDOs (e.g. DSC.ID) with security attributes listed in the next paragraph.
* OB.T_SDO - Transient SDOs or just SDOs (i.e. SDOs in the DSC currently, but are either ephemeral or are normally stored external to DSC when not in use) with security attributes listed in the next paragraphs. See <<Key Usage>>, <<Key Hierarchies>>, and <<SDEs and SDOs>> for more discussion on keys, which are the primary use cases for SDOs.
* OB.AuthData - Authorization Data (including authentication data, e.g. PINs, passwords, tokens) 
* OB.Pstate - Platform State (e.g. measurements and assertions)
* OB.FAACntr - Failed Authorization Attempt Counters
* OB.AntiReplay - Anti-replay tokens (e.g. counters, nonces, etc.)
* OB.Context - Session Context (The DSC may maintain one or more sessions with a CA involving one or more of SDOs, Authorization Data, Platform State, Failed Authorization Counters, and Anti-Replay Tokens. The DSC may represent internally the state of these objects at any given time in a Session Context) - See <<Sessions>> for more discussion on sessions.

Security Attributes: The following list contains the minimum security attributes for a DSC. Individual DSCs may implement additional security attributes beyond this (whether they are additional standalone attributes or additional attributes that are associated with SDOs); the ST author is expected to identify these.

* DSC.ID - The DSC identifier. It may also serve as the identifier for the DSC RoT.
* CA.ID - The Client Application identifier.
* EPS.ID - The External Platform Storage (EPS) identifier. This attribute is optional for a passive EPS (i.e. plain memory that only stores information). If the DSC uses a Client Application to manage storage, then support for this attribute is required.
* SDO.* - The SDO Security Attributes:
** SDO.ID - SDO Identifier
** SDO.Type - SDO Type
** SDO.AuthData - SDO Reference authorization data
** SDO.Reauth - SDO re-authorization conditions
** SDO.Conf - SDO Confidential SDE list
** SDO.Export - SDO export flag
** SDO.Integrity - SDO integrity protection data
** SDO.Bind - SDO binding data

Operations: The following list contains the expected operations of a DSC.

* OP.Import (See Parse) - The DSC may receive SDOs, SDEs, Authorization Data, Platform State, Anti-Replay Tokens or Session Contexts from the CA or the EPS. The Admin may also give the DSC Authorization Data.
* OP.Create (See Provision) - The DSC may create SDOs, SDEs, Authorization Data, Platform State, Anti-Replay Tokens, or Session Contexts with authorization from a CA or Admin.
* OP.Use (See Process) - The DSC may use or perform a cryptographic operation on Pre-Provisioned SDOs, Transient SDOs, SDEs, Authorization Data, Platform State, Anti-Replay Tokens, or Session Contexts with Create authorization from a CA or Admin. Cryptographic operations may include encryption, decryption, hashing, signature generation, and signature verification.
* OP.Modify (See Process) - The DSC may modify SDOs, SDEs, Authorization Data, Platform State, Anti-Replay Tokens, or Session Contexts with authorization from a CA or Admin.
* OP.Attest (See Prove) - The DSC may create an attestation of Platform State using an SDO or Pre-Provisioned SDO and Anti-Replay Tokens as authorized by a CA or Admin respectively. 
* OP.Store (See Protect) - The DSC may store SDOs, SDEs, Authorization Data, Platform State, Anti-Replay Tokens, or Session Contexts in protected storage of the DSC. See section 2.4.5 for more discussion on protected storage.
* OP.Export (See Propagate) - The DSC may export SDOs, SDEs, Authorization Data, Platform State, or Anti-Replay Tokens to a CA or EPS with the proper authorization from the owner of each object. In the case of EPS, the DSC will bind the objects to the DSC in such a way as to deny other DSCs or entities the ability to import, use, modify, attest, store, export, or destroy them. The DSC may export Session Contexts only to an EPS binding it in the same way as above.
* OP.Destroy (See Purge) - The DSC may purge SDOs, SDEs, Authorization Data, Platform State, Anti-Replay Tokens, or Session Contexts in protected storage with proper authorization from the owner of each object.

=== TOE Use Cases

DSCs are used in platforms to support mobile commerce, to manage platform credentials, manage user access to sensitive resources such as enterprise data centers or entertainment content servers, to manage and protect data-in-transit such as through secure channels or VPN tunnels, and to manage and protect keying, authentication, and authorization material for data-at-rest solutions such as self-encrypting drives.

For the mobile commerce use case, users, merchants, and financial institutions expect and require that financial transactions between them and their platforms be trusted and secure. For example,

* All peers to a transaction must be able to authenticate each other.
* The integrity of the transaction must be ensured.

To support such transactions, a DSC performs the following:

* Ingests data elements and attributes and exports the data objects associated with these transactions and the identities of the parties
* Generates data objects to use for these transactions.
* Securely stores data elements bound with their attributes within a protected hardware boundary.
* Authenticates and processes these data elements within a protected execution environment to ensure the authenticity of the parties and the transactions.
* Establishes secure communications channels between the parties to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the transactions.
* Securely erases data objects when no longer needed.
* Ensures its own integrity and authenticity prior to execution.

DSCs are implemented to satisfy the following use cases:

*[USE CASE 1] Protected Key Store*

A platform leveraging DSCs as a hardware-secured Private Key Store facilitates the use of secure and protected storage of secret symmetric keys and private asymmetric keys for access to data and services. These DSCs would provide safe use of the private and secret keys inside the protected hardware boundary.

*[USE CASE 2] User / Platform Authentication to Enterprise Managed Resources*

A platform leveraging DSCs for a hardware-secured ID facilitates the use of the platform as a secure and reliable form of authentication for authorized access to highly sensitive local or remote data and services.

*[USE CASE 3] Mobile Commerce*

A platform that uses DSCs facilitates secure storage and protected use of credentials for financial transactions between trusted and authorized users, platforms, merchants and financial institutions. These DSCs would provide safe use of the credentials inside the protected hardware boundary. The use of certified hardware-isolated credential stores on smart platforms and only unlocking their use with authenticated authorization provides confidence that the transaction was indeed authorized by the approved 'platform holder'.

=== Key Reference Model

The Key Reference Model abstraction draws inspiration from several different DSC products. The products distinguish themselves from one another in the types of keys supported, how they are protected, the types of applications supported, the number of layers of key, and the number of keys at each layer.

The following paragraphs describe the relationships between elements of the DSC.

==== Roles

There are two main roles that come into play with any platform, including the DSC. These are administrator and client applications. The DSC is often a component within a larger system or platform that is referred to as a platform from this point forward. Often the platform supports different roles as well. At times, these roles may coincide with the roles supported in the DSC, even on purpose.

The administrator may, among other things, accept responsibility for providing timely updates to the DSC, both feature updates and security updates. It may also be responsible for managing the pre-installed SDOs and the initial configuration of the DSC. Different administrators may have different authorities to manage the TSF; for example, one administrator may be responsible for controlling firmware updates while another may take an active part in managing the contents of the DSC installed post-manufacture.

An administrator may manage the contents of the DSC, including user content. A DSC administrator is not necessarily the owner of a given SDO. Although the DSC administrator may possibly own one or more SDOs, not all SDOs allow a DSC administrator direct control of it. In some cases, a DSC administrator may also be in a position to grant or deny another administrator access to what it perceives as their content, namely the DSC's firmware and possibly some keying material belonging to the manufacturer. A DSC manufacturer's choice of allowing an administrator of the DSC this kind of latitude is a feature of its product.

The CA role may also be further divided into multiple users. CAs can include:

* An application vendor acting on its own behalf to update software on the platform.
* A content provider controlling access to its content through an application.
* A human entity using the platform who has an identity that they use to authenticate themselves to the content provider through a CA.
* An original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that designed and manufactured a more complex system with the DSC as a component (assuming that the DSC manufacturer and the manufacturer of the more complex system using the DSC as a component are different entities).

In some cases, the DSC may allow the OEM to provision and manage its own content in the DSC for its own purpose, such as managing their firmware or software installed on the platform. In this case, the OEM is considered to be another CA under the control of the administrator. The role of administrator is not ascribed to the OEM since it likely does not control the manufacturer's firmware or key material and thus does not control the behavior of the DSC. Nor would the other CAs on the platform tolerate OEM control of their content stored in the DSC. Even so, there should be some separation between the administrator-owner and the other roles of the platform in terms of authorizing use of the contents assigned to each of the roles. For example, administrator-owners may deny access to contents, either temporarily or permanently (e.g., through cryptographic erase). However, they cannot themselves access their contents for their own use or to gain access to things they are not otherwise authorized to access.

==== Key Usage

One way to categorize keys is by the cryptographic functions they are allowed to participate in. When one creates a key, one often restricts its use to encryption and decryption, or to signature generation and verification. There are exceptions to this rule, especially in proof of possession protocols. However, certification regimes often require strict separation of usage in regards to encryption/decryption and signature generation/verification: one may use a key for one or the other, but never both. As such, a DSC may have to enforce this separation of usage for keys; this may mean that an attribute must accompany a key to help the DSC in its enforcement.

==== Sessions

Users may use their keys multiple times while in the DSC. Because authorization using public key methods tends to be resource intensive (i.e. uses a fair amount of internal memory and takes a long time), the DSC can use sessions to enforce authorization and manage access to the key within it. As an alternative to requiring authorization for each access to a key, the DSC could allow the user or owner of the key to open a session and provide the authorization when being used for the first time, then maintain the session and authorization using a series of less resource-intensive challenges and responses. Alternatively, in some instances, the DSC may require additional authorization (such as an elevation of privileges) to access keys (or different, related keys). Such a protocol of challenges and responses may generate and use ephemeral authorization tokens, which would be one form of critical security parameter (CSP). The DSC may have to switch session contexts in and out of the DSC to external temporary storage, which necessitates the protection of these CSPs. Such a session context is one type of SDO, to be discussed later.

==== Key Hierarchies

Another way to categorize keys is the relationship they have with each other. A DSC may have a key hierarchy, or key chain, whereby data-at-rest is protected by one or more keys, which are protected in turn by one or more additional keys, and potentially so on. This model calls out three categories of keys generally found on typical DSCs. DSCs may contain Root Keys, Intermediate (or Branch) Keys, and Leaf Keys.

Most DSCs have a concept of Root Keys. These keys are typically provisioned by the DSC manufacturer and have some permanence in the DSC. Root Keys may be derived from seeds (which is discussed later), injected at manufacturing time, or provisioned by a user. Root keys installed by the manufacturers are considered administrator key material. Typically, normal client applications, including OEMs, should not alter or erase this material unless specifically authorized to do so. Root keys installed by the administrator should be similarly restricted. Client application-installed root keys, on the other hand, are not considered as permanent since the client application or the administrator can remove them at any time without authorization.

Root Keys may either be encryption/decryption keys, signature verification keys, or signature generation keys. Encryption/decryption keys, or simply Root Encryption Key (REK), usually anchor a hierarchy of keys stored external to the DSC necessitating both the encrypt key to protect the key outside the DSC, and the decrypt key to expose its operations within the protected and secure confines of the DSC. The Signature Verification Keys from public key schemes should always contain the public portion and never the private portion. Use of Signature Generation keys as Root Keys is rare.

Most DSCs have a concept of Intermediate Keys. These are sometimes known as Branch Keys, Key Encryption Keys, and Key Wrapping Keys. In the SFRs of this cPP, these will be referred to as Key Encryption Keys (KEKs), even if the target of encryption is not a key. Intermediate Keys must always be encryption keys. Intermediate keys cannot be signing keys.

Note that although chained certificates (see certificates below) are one form of a sequence of keys, each of which signs another key, the creation and verification of such a chain of certificates is out of scope for the core requirements of the cPP; however, it may be added as a package if one or both of these features (creating the chain and verifying the chain) is indeed present in the DSC. Nonetheless, the primitives of signing and verification are present due to other cryptographic operations in scope for this cPP.

Intermediate Keys should always be protected (i.e. wrapped) by either a Root Key or another Intermediate Key.

Leaf Objects consist of Authorization Data and Leaf Keys. Leaf Keys can be either signing or encryption keys. Leaf Objects collectively refers to data that should be wrapped by either a Root Key or a KEK and is not subsequently used as a KEK itself. Encryption Leaf Keys do not wrap other keys (at least in the context of the DSC; what happens outside the DSC with Leaf Keys is out of its control). In many contexts, an Encryption Leaf Key is known as a Data Encryption Key (DEK). In the context of the DSC, this cPP will not assume how the user of the DSC will use the Leaf Keys it creates, and will refrain from using the term DEK.

Certificates contain either signed public keys, signed encryption/decryption keys, or some sort of Authorization Data. Signature keys come in several varieties: asymmetric signing keys, which contain a private key for signing (and maybe also the public key for verification) and verification keys, which contains only the public verification key and does not contain the private key (and thus cannot perform a signing function). There are also symmetric signature keys. In this case these consist of only a single key for both signing and verifying.

Authorization Data may have an arbitrary length of bits or bytes and may contain arbitrary or non-arbitrary values of bits or bytes.

Seeds have a special place in this Key Reference Model. Manufacturers, owners, and users of the DSC can use permanent seeds to create root keys. Manufacturers have good reasons to use seeds to derive Root Keys and other items in the Key Reference Model. These include:

* Seeds take less space to store than certain asymmetric keys for given desired cryptographic strengths.
* Having seeds that are unique per DSC enhances the chance that the same key derivation function on different DSCs will yield unique keys.

<<ExampleKeyHierarchy>> contains an example of a hierarchy of keys where each lower-level key is wrapped by a higher-level key that is connected to it. The Firmware Signature Key and the Root Encryption Key are examples of Root Keys. The Intermediate Wrapping Key is an example of an Intermediate Key. The Software Signature Key, the File Encryption Key, and the Streaming Movie Authorization Token are examples of Leaf Objects. <<ExampleKeyHierarchy>> serves as an illustration of key hierarchies; other configurations are possible.

.Example Key Hierarchy
[[ExampleKeyHierarchy]]
image::examplekeyhierarchy.png[,600]

Roles may play an important part in key hierarchies. One of the simplest models enforces a different hierarchy for each role at the root key level. Another way to put this is each hierarchy at the root key level supports a different role. However, for more complexity, once intermediate keys are allowed, then each intermediate key could serve as the root of a hierarchy of keys for a different role. Here is where the key functions and the roles come together. Roles may further divide into which role has the right to use a key, which role has the right to move the key from one parent to another, which role has the right to destroy a key, etc.

==== Protected Storage Locations

This cPP covers several different types of storage locations for keys and critical security parameters (CSPs) such as authentication tokens. Some DSCs may have a generous amount of protected storage internal to themselves, which allows it to accommodate all keys and CSPs in operational use, whether the DSC is performing operations to administer itself or operations on behalf of users. Other DSCs may have a minimal amount of protected storage locations with just enough to accommodate root keys along with a limited number of operational keys and CSPs for user authorized sessions.

For those cases in which the DSC relies on storage external to itself to accommodate all the keys and CSPs on which applications expect it to operate, it will either have to support secure channels to another DSC with a more generous allocation of protected storage locations, or use a series of wrapping keys to protect private keys and CSPs while outside of the DSC. Whether the DSC is powered on or powered off, the DSC is expected to provide support for protected storage locations for its root keys. If the DSC uses external storage without secure channels, then it should be ready to wrap both intermediate wrapping keys as well as the Leaf Objects. This implies that there will be some sort of structure on each of these items stored external to the DSC. The next section discusses that structure.

A conformant TOE may include "write-once" storage such as single-use eFuses. Since data is written to any such storage as part of the initial provisioning of the TOE, the data is considered immutable once the TOE has entered its evaluated configuration. The integrity of this data is maintained through the physical properties of its storage medium.

==== SDEs and SDOs

Although there is another section written about SDEs and SDOs, this section is used to map keys and authentication tokens to SDEs and SDOs. This cPP does not impose a strict structure on the items in the key hierarchy. An X.509 certificate is one example of a strict structure of a key with attributes. Collecting attributes of an SDE and composing an SDO structure with an SDE and attribute fields imposes temporal and storage penalties in all cases. In certain resource-constrained cases the attributes could be implicit. For example, the root keys are administrative keys, which requires administrator authentication for use while all other objects are user objects, which require user authentication. The raw unadorned key or object is the SDE and the SDO may be implied by virtue of its location within the hierarchy, i.e. it is understood that keys in the root position require administrator authentication while all other objects, which may or may not be keys, require user authentication.

In the previous section on protected storage locations, a DSC may have to use storage external to itself. In these cases, an SDO of a wrapped key may contain a number of important attributes, such as a pointer to its parent, authorization values, and other indications of the functions allowed (encrypt vs. sign). Alternatively, some or all attributes may be implied, which means that only the keys or CSPs themselves exist outside the DSC. In either case, the sensitive values, such as private keys, secret keys, and CSPs, should be encrypted when outside the DSC. The parent of these objects are either intermediate wrapping keys, or encrypting root keys.

Some DSCs may want to distinguish between SDEs created within itself from SDEs ingested from an external source. Additionally, some DSCs may output SDEs without additional context or attributes from the DSC. A DSC, in some contexts, will not distinguish an ingested SDO from raw keys.

== CC Conformance Claims

As defined by the references [CC1], [CC2] and [CC3], this cPP:

* conforms to the requirements of Common Criteria v3.1, Release 5
* is Part 2 extended, Part 3 conformant
* does not claim conformance to any other PP or package.

The methodology applied for the cPP evaluation is defined in [CEM] and refined by the Evaluation Activities in [SD]. This cPP satisfies the following Assurance Families: APE_CCL.1, APE_ECD.1, APE_INT.1, APE_OBJ.2, APE_REQ.2 and APE_SPD.1.

In order to be conformant to this cPP, a TOE must demonstrate Exact Conformance. Exact Conformance is defined as the ST containing all of the requirements in <<Security Objectives>> of this cPP (these are the mandatory SFRs), and potentially requirements from <<Optional Requirements>> (these are optional SFRs) or <<Selection-Based Requirements>> (these are selection-based SFRs, some of which will be mandatory according to the selections made in other SFRs) of this cPP. While iteration is allowed, no additional requirements (from CC Parts 2 or 3, or definitions of extended components not already included in this cPP) are allowed to be included in the ST. Further, no requirements in <<Security Objectives>> of this cPP are allowed to be omitted.

The PPs and PP-Modules that are allowed to be specified in a PP-Configuration with this cPP are specified on the https://dsc-itc.github.io/[DSC-iTC website] Allowed Components page.

== Security Problem Definition

=== Assets

(R.AUTHDATA) Authorization Data that the TOE manages in support of the authorization services that it offers, including both user-provided authentication tokens and authorization values and those created by the TOE. Authorization Data may be special cases of SDEs, or they may be attributes in an SDO. The TSF may use Authorization Data to manage the use and disposition of a single SDE, or a broad class of SDEs. The TOE protects the integrity of Authorization Data, and in some cases, may protect their confidentiality.

(R.CONFKEY) Confidential (or secret) keys used in symmetric cryptographic functions and private keys used in asymmetric cryptographic functions are managed and used by the TOE in support of the cryptographic services that it offers. This includes user keys that are owned and used by a specific user (which are a special case of an SDE), and support keys used in the implementation and operation of the TOE. The confidentiality and integrity of these keys must be protected*.*

(R.PUBKEY) Public keys are managed and used by the TOE in support of the cryptographic services that it offers (including user keys and support keys). This includes user keys that are owned and used by a specific user (which are a special case of an SDE), and support keys used in the implementation and operation of the TOE. The integrity of these keys must be protected.

(R.SDE) An SDE is an item of user data that is held in (and may be stored on) the TOE and that may be used only by an authorized subject (i.e. a user or process acting on behalf of that user). Typically the TOE will not know what an SDE represents in terms of the application or service that it is used for: it will characterize an SDE only in terms of the authorization requirements that are necessary to access it (i.e. the presentation and possibly processing of authorization data presented to the TOE), and the operations that can be performed on or with it after authorization has been achieved. An SDE may require protection of its confidentiality, its integrity, or both.

(R.SDO) An SDO comprises one or more SDEs that are collectively bound to one or more attributes (e.g. an identifier for the identity that a key or authorization data is associated with). These attributes may necessarily be used by the TSF to enforce authorization policies concerning the allowed use and disposition of the subject SDEs. The bindings can either be explicit (e.g. in a well-formatted standards-based data structure) or implicit (e.g. by virtue of their location within the TOE which implies privileges of use and disposition by certain users), or a combination of both.

=== Threats

(T.BRUTE_FORCE_AUTH) An unauthorized user may attempt to gain unauthorized access to the TOE by repeatedly and rapidly supplying a large number of permutations of authorization data, such as passwords, biometrics, etc. that protect the SDEs, in the hopes that valid authorization data can be obtained through brute force. A successful brute force attack puts the SDE/SDO data, user identity, and the TOE's underlying platform at risk.

The consequences of risks to SDEs include the loss of confidentiality of the SDE or SDO data, unauthorized access to and use of this data, destruction of this data, and the ability of the adversary to impersonate a user or that user's platform.

(T.HW_ATTACK) An individual with physical access to the TOE may apply hardware attacks such as probing, physical manipulation, fault-injection, environmental stress, or reactivating blocked test-features or other pre-delivery services to manipulate the behavior of the TOE to disclose SDOs.

(T.SDE_TRANSIT_COMPROMISE) An attacker with the ability to observe data transmission into and out of the TOE may access or determine plaintext values of keys, authorization data, and other SDEs as the TSF transmits them into or out of the TOE. This puts the SDE/SDO data, user identity, and the TOE's underlying platform at risk.

The consequences of access to plaintext SDEs in this way include the loss of confidentiality of SDE/SDO data, unauthorized use of this data, unauthorized modification of this data, and the ability of the adversary to impersonate a user or their platform.

(T.UNAUTH_UPDATE) An unauthorized user may force the platform to update the TOE with firmware that compromises its security features. Poorly chosen update protocols, cryptographic algorithms, and keys sizes may allow adversaries to install software or firmware that bypasses security features or rolls back to firmware versions with compromised security features and provides them with unauthorized access to SDEs.

The consequences of risks to firmware include the loss of confidentiality of the SDE/SDO data, unauthorized access to and use of this data, destruction of this data, and the ability of the adversary to impersonate a user or that user's platform.

(T.UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS) An unauthorized user may gain unauthorized access to one or more SDEs within the TOE. If an adversary gains access to SDEs/SDOs stored in the TSF, they may attempt to view, use, or destroy this data as well as impersonate a user or that user's platform.

The consequences of unauthorized access to SDEs/SDOs include the loss of confidentiality of their content, unauthorized use of that content, unauthorized modification or destruction of that content, and the ability of the adversary to impersonate a user or that user's platform.

(T.WEAK_CRYPTO) An unauthorized user or attacker that observes network traffic transmitted to and from the TOE may cryptographically exploit poorly chosen cryptographic algorithms, random bit generators, ciphers or key sizes. Weak cryptography chosen by users or by TSF protection mechanisms puts the user's data, identity, and platform at risk of exploitation by adversaries.

The consequences of risks to SDEs include the loss of confidentiality of the SDE/SDO data, unauthorized access to and use of this data, destruction of this data, and the ability of the adversary to impersonate a user or that user's platform.

(T.WEAK_ELEMENT_BINDING) An unauthorized user may successfully break the association between SDEs, for example to replace one element with another element.

The consequences of manipulation of SDEs in this way include the loss of confidentiality of the data, unauthorized use of the data, destruction of the data, unauthorized modification of credentials, and the ability of the adversary to impersonate a user or that user's platform.

(T.WEAK_OWNERSHIP_BINDING) A user may successfully access or manipulate SDEs that they do not own.

The consequences of manipulation of SDEs in this way include the loss of confidentiality of SDE/SDO data, unauthorized use of that data, unauthorized modification of that data, and the ability of the adversary to impersonate a user or that user's platform.

=== Assumptions

This section describes the assumptions made in identification of the threats and security requirements for dedicated security components. The dedicated security component is not expected to provide assurance in any of these areas, and as a result, requirements are not included to mitigate the threats associated.

(A.AUTH_USERS) Authorized users follow all provided guidance regarding the safeguarding of SDEs held outside the TOE.

(A.CREDENTIAL_REVOCATION) If a platform is lost, stolen, or compromised then there is a method of revocation of any credentials held (or equivalent method of mitigating the impact of potential access to the credentials). Credential revocation ensures that the loss of physical custody does not have significant negative impact on the security of the platform. This implies that an attacker has only limited access to the device to apply attacks. It further implies that the device owner is not seen as an attacker.

(A.ROT_INTEGRITY) The vendor provides a RoT that is comprised of the TOE firmware, hardware, and pre-installed SDOs, free of intentionally malicious capabilities. The platform trusts the RoT since it cannot verify the integrity and authenticity of the RoT.

If the RoT is immutable, then the platform can have confidence that once delivered, malicious actors cannot modify the RoT to add malicious capabilities. If the RoT is mutable (e.g. the firmware and pre-installed SDOs), then it will verify the authenticity and integrity of the updates before applying them.

(A.TRUSTED_PEER) The remote peer communicating over a secure channel is trustworthy, and will not abuse the secure channel in order to introduce malware or fraudulent SDEs into the TOE.

=== Organizational Security Policies

There are no organizational security policies defined in this cPP.

== Security Objectives 

=== Security Objectives for the TOE

(O.AUTH_FAILURES) The TOE resists repeated attempts to guess authorization data by responding to consecutive failed attempts in a way that prevents an attacker from exploring a significant amount of the space of possible authorization data values.

(O.AUTHORIZATION) The TOE authorizes only authenticated subjects to access SDOs stored by authenticated users of the TOE, pre-installed SDOs stored in the RoT by the manufacturer of the TOE, and management functions that are used to manipulate the TSF and its stored data.

(O.DATA_PROTECTION) The TOE provides authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity services for SDOs.

(O.FW_INTEGRITY) The TOE ensures its own integrity has remained intact and attests its integrity to outside parties on request.

(O.PARSE_PROTECTION) All SDEs are received by the TOE over a secure channel for parsing, protecting confidentiality and integrity of the SDEs while in transit. The TOE authenticates the source of all SDEs received, and authenticates itself to the remote peer.

(O.PURGE_PROTECTION) The TOE provides secure destruction of SDEs when they are deleted, so that the previous value of the SDE can no longer be accessed (and cannot be restored).

(O.SECURE_UPDATE) The TOE software/firmware either does not allow update, or else implements a mechanism that ensures only authorized updates are applied. If the TOE allows updating its firmware, it is required to implement a mechanism that ensures only authorized firmware can be loaded into the TOE. A secure update mechanism ensures the firmware is authorized through verification of its integrity and authenticity while also preventing rollback to a previous and potentially vulnerable firmware instance.

(O.STRONG_BINDING) The TOE provides a mechanism for binding data to its attributes (including the identity of its owner) and prevents unauthorized changes to data attributes.

The protections for pre-installed SDEs/SDOs come through the firmware protections. For example, only authorized updates to the firmware contains the functionality that determines the attributes of the pre-installed SDOs. In the same vein, the authorized updates may also affect the SDEs as well, if the vendor so chooses. The authorized update binds the attributes present in the functionality of the firmware to the pre-installed SDEs.

(O.STRONG_CRYPTO) The TOE implements strong cryptographic mechanisms and algorithms according to recognized standards, including support for random bit generation based on recognized standards and a source of sufficient entropy. The TOE uses key sizes that are recognized as providing sufficient resistance to current attack capabilities.

=== Security Objectives for the Operational Environment

The Operational Environment of the TOE implements technical and procedural measures to assist the TOE in correctly providing its security functionality. This section defines security objectives for the Operational Environment and consists of a set of statements describing the goals that the Operational Environment should achieve.

(OE.AUTH_USERS) Authenticated users follow all provided guidance regarding the safeguarding of SDEs, especially authentication tokens such as passwords, pass-phrases, and biometrics.

(OE.PHYSICAL) The platform holder will ensure that an attacker has no prolonged, unsupervised physical access to the platform. If a platform is lost or stolen then the platform holder will promptly initiate revocation of any credentials held (or equivalent method of mitigating the impact of potential access to the credentials).

This security objective for the operating environment expects an entity to wipe the contents of the TOE in the event that an attacker has prolonged unsupervised physical access to the platform containing the TOE. There exists a variety of methods to wipe the contents or render the contents useless to the attacker. The platform may institute its own signal to wipe the TOE upon reaching or exceeding a threshold of unsuccessful user authentication or authorization attempts by an attacker. A remote entity may signal to the platform that it should issue a signal to the TOE to wipe is contents. The platform user (who has lost physical access to the platform) may contact service providers and inform them of the loss of credentials in the TOE, who may in turn issue revocation of those credentials.

(OE.TRUSTED_PEER) Connections using secure channels are made only to trusted peers, in whom confidence has been established that they will not abuse the secure channel in order to introduce malware or fraudulent SDEs into the TOE.

|===

The objectives can map to multiple assumptions or threats to fully define the objectives of the TOE and the operational environment.

== Security Functional Requirements

The individual security functional requirements are specified in the sections below. Based on selections made in these SFRs it will also be necessary to include some of the selection-based SFRs in Appendix B. Additional optional SFRs may also be adopted from those listed in Appendix A for those functions that are provided by the TOE instead of its Operational Environment.

The Evaluation Activities defined in [SD] describe actions that the evaluator shall take in order to determine compliance of a particular TOE with the SFRs. The content of these Evaluation Activities will therefore provide more insight into deliverables required from TOE Developers.

=== Conventions

The conventions used in descriptions of the SFRs are as follows:

* Unaltered SFRs are stated in the form used in [CC2] or their extended component definition (ECD);
* Refinement made in the PP: the added/removed text is indicated with *bold text*/[.line-through]#strikethroughs#. When text is substituted (i.e. some text is added in place of some other text, which is then deleted), only the added text is included;

Note that a refinement is also used to indicate cases where the PP replaces an assignment defined for an SFR in [CC2] and replaces it with a selection;

* Selections:

** Wholly or partially completed in the PP: the selection values (i.e. the selection values adopted in the PP or the remaining selection values available for the ST) are indicated with [.underline]#underlined text#;
+
e.g. "[_selection: disclosure, modification, loss of use_]" in [CC2] or an ECD might become "[.underline]#disclosure#" (completion) or "[.underline]#selection: disclosure, modification#" (partial completion) in the PP;

** Some SFRs include selections that determine or constrain other assignments or selections. In these cases, a table follows the requirement in which each row of the table defines a permitted set of choices. Each row includes a unique identifier defined solely to provide a label for the selection set. Individual entries in these tables may also require further selections or assignments.
+
e.g. for FCS_CKM.1/AKG (see <<SampleCrypto>>), the ST for a TOE that supports RSA keys must include the entries for 'key type', 'key sizes', and 'list of standards' as specified in row 1AK. For 'key sizes', the ST author must further select which of the required key sizes are supported. The row identifiers are merely intended as quick-reference handles—there is no expectation that the TSF actually refer internally to RSA keys using this identifier. Likewise, if the TOE supports ECC the ST must include the entries from row 2AK along with the appropriate selections.

* Assignment wholly or partially completed in the PP: indicated with _italicized text_;
* Assignment completed within a selection in the PP: the completed assignment text is indicated with _[.underline]#italicized and underlined text#_

e.g. "{empty}[[.underline]#selection: change_default, query, modify, delete, [_assignment: other operations_#]]" in [CC2] or an ECD might become "[.underline]#[change_default, [_select_tag_#]]" (completion of both selection and assignment) or "[.underline]#[selection: change_default, select_tag, [_select_value_#]]" (partial completion of selection, and completion of assignment) in the PP;

* Iteration: indicated by adding a string starting with "/" (e.g. "FCS_COP.1/Hash").

SFR text that is bold, italicized, and underlined indicates that the original SFR defined an assignment operation but the PP author completed that assignment by redefining it as a selection operation, which is also considered to be a refinement of the original SFR.

If the selection or assignment is to be completed by the ST author, it is preceded by 'selection:' or 'assignment:'. If the selection or assignment has been completed by the PP author and the ST author does not have the ability to modify it, the proper formatting convention is applied but the preceding word is not included. The exception to this is if the SFR definition includes multiple options in a selection or assignment and the PP has excluded certain options but at least two remain. In this case, the selection or assignment operations that are not permitted by this PP are removed without applying additional formatting and the 'selection:' or 'assignment:' text is preserved to show that the ST author still has the ability to choose from the reduced set of options.

Extended SFRs (i.e. those SFRs that are not defined in [CC2]) are identified by having a label '_EXT' at the end of the SFR name.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This SFR captures methods for multi-party key agreement in which multiple parties contribute material used to derive the shared key used by each party to encrypt and decrypt messages to and from each other. TOEs can use the derived keys as symmetric keys, keyed-hash keys, or cryptographic keys for key derivation functions._
+
_FCS_CKM.5 defines KDF-CTR, KDF-FB, and KDF-DPI._
+
_For the KDF functions, when concatenating keys for AES-CMAC, the contributions from each party should be an equal number of bits, resulting in the selected key size (e.g., if each share is 128 bits, then the result after concatenation is a 256-bit key, which is appropriate only for AES-256-CMAC). For HMAC functions, the shares can be any size as long as the concatenated result is at least equal to or greater than the nominal cryptographic strength of the chosen hash function (e.g. if each share is 128 bits, then the result after concatenation is 256 bits, which can be used in any of SHA-1, SHA-256, or SHA-512)._
+
_For the KDF functions and XOR, each party may have to use an asymmetric method from FCS_CKM_EXT.7 to transmit their shares to each other. Key shares may also come from a token, in which case, TOEs may use key access methods in FCS_CKM.3 to authorize access and use of those keys in this SFR._
+
_For KEK, encrypting one key with another, one must use one of the algorithms listed in FCS_COP.1/SKC._
+
_For cPP/ST authors, please consider the assumptions that opposite parties in the operational environment contribute keying material that meets the same requirements._

==== FCS_CKM.6 Cryptographic Key Destruction

FCS_CKM.6 Cryptographic Key Destruction

FCS_CKM.6.1:: The TSF shall destroy [*assignment*: _list of cryptographic keys (including keying material)_] when [*selection*: _no longer needed, [*assignment*: other circumstances for key or keying material destruction]_].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _The TOE will have mechanisms to destroy keys, including intermediate keys and key material, by using an approved method as specified in FCS_CKM.6.2. Examples of keys include intermediate keys, leaf keys, encryption keys, signing keys, verification keys, authentication tokens, entry points to key chains, and submasks. Key material includes seeds, secret authorization values, passwords, PINs, and other secret values used to derive keys. The ST Author shall list all such keys and keying material that are subject to destruction in the first assignment._
+
_Based on their implementation, vendors will explain when certain keys are no longer needed. An example in which key is no longer necessary includes a wrapped key whose password has changed. This SFR does not apply to the public component of asymmetric key pairs, or to keys that are permitted to remain stored such as device identification keys._

FCS_CKM.6.2:: The TSF shall destroy cryptographic keys and keying material specified by FCS_CKM.6.1 in accordance with a specified cryptographic key destruction method [.underline]#[*selection*:#

. [.underline]#For volatile memory, the destruction shall be executed by a [*selection*:# 
.. [.underline]#single overwrite consisting of [*selection*:# 
... [.underline]#a pseudo-random pattern using the TSF's RBG,#
... [.underline]#zeroes,#
... [.underline]#ones,#
... [.underline]#a new value of a key,#
... [.underline]#[*_assignment*: some value that does not contain any CSP_]],#
.. [.underline]#removal of power to the memory,#
.. [.underline]#removal of all references to the key directly followed by a request for garbage collection];#
. [.underline]#For non-volatile memory [*selection*:#
.. [.underline]#that employs a wear-leveling algorithm, the destruction shall be executed by a [*selection*:#
... [.underline]#single overwrite consisting of [*selection*: zeroes, ones, pseudo-random pattern, a new value of a key of the same size, [*_assignment:* some value that does not contain any CSP_]],# 
... [.underline]#block erase];#
.. [.underline]#that does not employ a wear-leveling algorithm, the destruction shall be executed by a [*selection*:#
... [.underline]#[*selection*: single, [*_assignment:* ST author defined multi-pass_]] overwrite consisting of [*selection*: zeros, ones, pseudo-random pattern, a new value of a key of the same size, [*_assignment:* some value that does not contain any CSP_]] followed by a read-verify. If the read-verification of the overwritten data fails, the process shall be repeated again up to [*_assignment:* number of times to attempt overwrite_] times, whereupon an error is returned.#
... [.underline]#block erase]#
+
]] that meets the following: [_no standard_].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _In the case of volatile memory, the selection "removal of all references to the key directly followed by a request for garbage collection" is used in a situation where the TSF cannot address the specific physical memory locations holding the data to be erased and therefore relies on addressing logical addresses (which frees the relevant physical addresses holding the old data) and then requesting the platform to ensure that the data in the physical addresses is no longer available for reading (i.e. the "garbage collection" referred to in the SFR text)._
+
_The selection for destruction of data in non-volatile memory includes block erase as an option, and this option applies only to flash memory. A block erase does not require a read verify, since the mappings of logical addresses to the erased memory locations are erased as well as the data itself._
+
_The TSS includes a table describing all relevant keys and keying material, their sources, all memory types in which they are stored (covering storage both during and outside of a session, and both plaintext and encrypted forms), the applicable destruction method, and time of destruction for each case._
+
_Some selections allow assignment of "some value that does not contain any CSP." This means that the TOE uses some specified data not drawn from an RBG meeting FCS_RBG_EXT requirements, and not being any of the particular values listed as other selection options. The point of the phrase "does not contain any sensitive data" is to ensure that the overwritten data is carefully selected, and not taken from a general pool that might contain data that itself requires confidentiality protection._

==== FCS_COP.1/Hash Cryptographic Operation (Hashing)

FCS_COP.1/Hash Cryptographic Operation (Hashing)

FCS_COP.1.1/Hash:: The TSF shall perform [_cryptographic hashing_] in accordance with a specified cryptographic algorithm {empty}[*selection*: [.underline]#SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512]#* that meets the following: {empty}[*selection*: [.underline]#ISO/IEC 10118-3:2018, FIPS PUB 180-4, FIPS PUB 202]#*.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _The hash selection should be consistent with the overall strength of the algorithm used for signature generation. For example, the TOE should choose SHA-256 for 2048-bit RSA or ECC with P-256, SHA-384 for 3072-bit RSA, 4096-bit RSA, or ECC with P-384, and SHA-512 for ECC with P-521. The ST author selects the standard based on the algorithms selected._
+
_SHA-1 may be used for the following applications: generating and verifying hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs), key derivation functions (KDFs), and random bit/number generation_.footnote:[In certain cases, SHA-1 may also be used for verifying old digital signatures and time stamps, provided that this is explicitly allowed by the application domain.]
+
_Since there are no keys involved with hashing, there are no cryptographic key-based dependencies necessary for this SFR._

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _The TSF shall generate cryptographic one-time values, often non-secret, such as nonces, IVs, salts, and initial counters (sometimes called initial sequential nonces) using the output of an RBG specified in FCS_RBG_EXT.1. If the TSF is generating OTVs, then this SFR is used. Otherwise, the TSF may obtain OTVs through importing and use FCS_ITC_EXT.1 or  FDP_ITC.1 for importing values for cryptographic operations._
+
_Salts help protect against dictionary and other precomputation attacks. Systems often prepend or append salts to passwords and other long-term, potentially guessable, values to increase the size of a dictionary an attacker must build to attack it. Salts, once associated with a password, generally do not change for the life of that password. Salts should also be unique for each password and should not be reused. Therefore, systems should randomly generate salts with sufficient size such that the combined entropy of both the salt and the password meet minimal key strength sizes of the chosen algorithms._
+
_Nonces help protect against replay attacks in cryptographic authentication protocols and some encryption modes. A nonce should never repeat. Using a sequence of nonces with a counter embedded in the value will ensure a nonce will never repeat. In protocol sessions which require multiple nonces, using sequential nonces that increments for each message, the receiver can check for and only accept an increase in the nonce value to verify that the message has not been replayed. In some protocols, the initial sequential nonce only needs to be sent once at the beginning of the session and the receiver can predict the remaining nonces in that session, which saves transmission bandwidth. Randomly generated nonces protect against attacks against sessions in which multiple keys are expected to be used. Therefore, nonces should be both randomly generated and never repeat. However, sequential nonces may be predictable. NIST provides additional guidance for the composition of a nonce in NIST SP 800-38c, NIST SP 800-56Ar3, NIST SP 800-56Br2, NIST SP 800-63B, and NIST SP 800-90Ar1._
+
_Initialization Vectors (IVs) help protect against attacks which depend on the reuse of static keys. Certain encryption modes often require IVs. They should be randomly generated in a nonpredictable way, cannot be sequential, and cannot repeat._
+
_Each algorithm and mode have varying guidance on the lengths of the salts, nonces and initialization vectors used therein. Please consult the referenced standards documents for the appropriate guidance for each._

==== FDP_ACC.1 Subset Access Control

FDP_ACC.1 Subset Access Control

FDP_ACC.1.1:: The TSF shall enforce the[_Access Control SFP_] on [
+
* _Subjects: S.DSC, S.Admin, S.CA, S.EPS_
* _Objects: OB.P_SDO, OB.T_SDO, OB.AuthData, OB.Pstate, OB.FAACntr, OB.AntiReplay, OB.Context_
* _Operations: OP.Import, OP.Create, OP.Use, OP.Modify, OP.Attest, OP.Store, OP.Export, OP.Destroy_].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _The set of operations specified in the assignment can be collectively referred to as "access." Any subsequent use of the term "access" should be interpreted to refer to one or more of these events._

==== FDP_ACF.1 Security Attribute Based Access Control

FDP_ACF.1 Security Attribute Based Access Control

FDP_ACF.1.1:: The TSF shall enforce the [_Access Control SFP_] to objects based on the following: [_subjects (defined in FDP_ACC.1.1) attempt to perform operations (defined in FDP_ACC.1.1) against objects (defined in FDP_ACC.1.1). Subject and object attributes may be used to determine whether the desired operations are permitted._
+
_The following are the SFP-relevant security attributes that are associated with the subjects and objects defined in FDP_ACC.1.1, as well as any restrictions on the attribute values:_
+
* _S.DSC_
** _DSC.ID_
* _S.Admin - none_ 
* _S.CA_
** _CA.ID_
* _S.EPS_
** _EPS.ID_
* _OB.P_SDO_

* _OB.Pstate - none_
* _OB.FAACntr - none_
* _OB.AntiReplay - none_
* _OB.Context- none_
+
].

FDP_ACF.1.2The TSF shall enforce the following rules to determine if an operation among controlled subjects and controlled objects is allowed:

* [_Any subject that has been authorized to perform any operation against any OB.P_SDO or OB.T_SDO object can continue to perform this operation if one of the following conditions is true:_
** _The object's SDO.Reauth attribute has a value of 'none', indicating that re-authorization is not required for subsequent interactions with the SDO;_
** _The object's SDO.Reauth attribute has a value of 'each use', indicating that re-authorization is required for each interaction with the SDO, and the subject has supplied valid authorization data to the TOE_
* _[assignment: rules automatically enforced by the TSF that always prohibit certain subject-object-operation actions]_
* _[assignment: rules automatically enforced by the TSF that always permit certain subject-object-operation actions]_
* _[assignment: rules automatically enforced by the TSF that conditionally permit certain subject-object-operation actions based on subject security attributes, object security attributes, or other conditions]_
* _[.underline]#[selection: [assignment: any configurable rules or parameters that can be modified to affect the behavior of the Access Control SFP], no configurable rules]#_].

FDP_ACF.1.3 The TSF shall explicitly authorize access of subjects to objects based on the following additional rules: [_assignment: rules, based on security attributes, that explicitly authorize access of subjects to objects_].

FDP_ACF.1.4 The TSF shall explicitly deny access of subjects to objects based on the following additional rules: [_client applications can only access their own data, [assignment: rules, based on security attributes, that explicitly deny access of subjects to objects]_].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _The expectation of this SFR is that the reader is given sufficient information to determine, for each object controlled by the TOE, the operations that can be performed on it based on the subject attempting to perform the operation, and whether this is conditional based on attribute values or any other circumstances._
+
_It is expected that many of the subject-object-operation combinations will always be prohibited by the TSF, either because the target object is not externally modifiable or because the subject lacks the ability to perform the operation in question._
+
_The ST author is not expected to create an exhaustive list of subject-object-operation combinations; it is sufficient to list those that are always permitted and those that are conditionally permitted with the expectation that all remaining combinations are prohibited._
+
_FDP_ACF.1.3 and FDP_ACF.1.4 allow the ST author to optionally specify override conditions to resolve otherwise contradictory Access Control SFP rules. For example, the rule "S.Admin may always modify the SDO.Conf attribute of any OB.P_SDO or OB.T_SDO object" may be overridden by a statement in FDP_ACF.1.4 that identifies any particular SDO objects as non-modifiable regardless of subject authorizations._

==== FDP_ETC_EXT.2 Propagation of SDOs

FDP_ETC_EXT.2 Propagation of SDOs

FDP_ETC_EXT.2.1:: The TSF shall propagate only SDO references, wrapped authorization data, and wrapped SDOs such that only [.underline]#[selection: the TSF, authorized users]# can access them.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _The "SDO reference" is a pointer to an object that resides in the TOE; this can be thought of as a token to the object. The "only the TSF can unwrap the data" selection refers to data that is stored outside the TOE boundary (i.e., data that has been propagated)._

==== FDP_FRS_EXT.1 Factory Reset

FDP_FRS_EXT.1 Factory Reset

FDP_FRS_EXT.1.1:: The TSF shall permit a factory reset of the TOE upon: [.underline]#[selection: activation by external interface, presentation of [_assignment: types of authorization data required and reference to their specification_], no actions or conditions]#.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _If the DSC provides factory reset and requires an authorization to carry out the operation then the ST author selects either [.underline]#presentation of…# and fills in the authorization data accepted (e.g. a PIN or a cryptographic token based on some specification referenced in the assigned value). If the DSC provides factory reset external to the DSC without requiring authorization then the ST author selects [.underline]#activation by external interface#. This selection is intended for use when the device containing the DSC takes responsibility for obtaining and checking the authorization for factory reset._
+
_If any selection other than [.underline]#no actions or conditions# is made in FDP_FRS_EXT.1.1, the selection-based SFR FDP_FRS_EXT.2 must be claimed._

==== FDP_ITC_EXT.1 Parsing of SDEs

FDP_ITC_EXT.1 Parsing of SDEs

FDP_ITC_EXT.1.1:: The TSF shall support importing SDEs using [.underline]#[selection: physically protected channels as specified in FTP_ITP_EXT.1, encrypted data buffers as specified in FTP_ITE_EXT.1, cryptographically protected data channels as specified in FTP_ITC_EXT.1]#.

FDP_ITC_EXT.1.3:: The TSF shall ignore any security attributes associated with the user data when imported from outside the TOE.

FDP_ITC_EXT.1.4:: The TSF shall bind SDEs to security attributes using [_assignment: list of ways the TSF generates security attributes and binds them to the SDEs_].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _The way the TSF checks the integrity of the SDE depends on the method of importation. For example, the encrypted data channel may provide data integrity as part of its service._
+
_When a TSF parses an SDE, it should generate security attributes and create an SDO by binding the security attributes to the SDE._
+
_If [.underline]#physically protected channels as specified in FTP_ITC_EXT.1# is selected, the selection-based SFR FTP_ITP_EXT.1 must be claimed._

FDP_ITC_EXT.2.2:: The TSF shall verify the integrity of the SDO using [.underline]#[selection: cryptographic hash as specified in FCS_COP.1/Hash, keyed hash as specified in FCS_COP.1/KeyedHash, integrity-providing encryption algorithm as specified in FCS_COP.1/KeyWrap, digital signature as specified in FCS_COP.1/SigVer, integrity verification supported by FDP_ITC_EXT.2.1]#.

FDP_ITC_EXT.2.3:: The TSF shall use the security attributes associated with the imported user data.

FDP_ITC_EXT.2.4:: The TSF shall ensure that the protocol used provides for the unambiguous association between the security attributes and the user data received.

FDP_ITC_EXT.2.5:: The TSF shall ensure that interpretation of the security attributes of the imported user data is as intended by the source of the user data.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _The way the TSF checks the integrity of the SDO depends on the method of importation. For example, the encrypted data channel may provide data integrity as part of its service._
+
_When a TSF parses an SDO, it should already have a set of security attributes. However, the TSF may modify these attributes, if authorized, to comply with security policies on the TOE._
+
_If [.underline]#physically protected channels as specified in FTP_ITC_EXT.1# is selected, the selection-based SFR FTP_ITP_EXT.1 must be claimed._

==== FDP_MFW_EXT.1 Mutable/Immutable Firmware

FDP_MFW_EXT.1 Mutable/Immutable Firmware

FDP_MFW_EXT.1.1:: The TSF shall be maintained as [.underline]#[selection: immutable, mutable]# firmware.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _The ST author must include FDP_MFW_EXT.2, FDP_MFW_EXT.3, FPT_FLS.1/FW, and FPT_RPL.1/Rollback if [.underline]#mutable# is selected._

==== FDP_RIP.1 Subset Residual Information Protection

FDP_RIP.1 Subset Residual Information Protection

FDP_RIP.1.1:: The TSF shall ensure that any previous information content of a resource is made unavailable upon the [_deallocation of the resource from_] the following objects: [
+
* _SDOs_
* _SDEs_].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _When an SDE is a key then it is also subject to the key destruction requirements in FCS_CKM.6, depending on where and how it is stored. This SFR applies to authorization data that are SDEs and security attributes in SDOs._

==== FDP_SDC.2 Stored data confidentiality with dedicated method

FDP_SDC.2 Stored data confidentiality with dedicated method

FDP_SDC.2.1:: The TSF shall ensure the confidentiality of the [.underline]#[the following user data [assignment: _list of internally and externally stored SDEs_]#] according to {empty}[assignment: [.underline]#_SDEs identified in the Confidential SDE List attribute of an SDO_#] while it is stored under the control of the TSF.

FDP_SDC.2.2:: The TSF shall ensure the confidentiality of the user data specified in FDP_SDC.2.1 without user intervention.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This SFR applies to confidential SDEs, especially secret and private keys, Allowed Random Number Generators' state data, and vendor verification reference data. This SFR also applies to all authorization data appearing in the attribute list under SDO.AuthData as well as any administrator authorization data which may be stored implicitly._
+
_If the TOE stores these parameters outside of its boundary, it must encrypt them according to the cryptographic requirements for key encryption, as required by FDP_ETC_EXT.2._
+
_Vendor pre-installed SDOs includes both objects installed during manufacturing, and those provisioned by the vendor before final release to customer. The administrator and no one else owns and controls these objects._
+
_The confidential-SDE List attribute of the SDO indicates those SDEs that require confidentiality. If SDEs do not require confidentiality, then its omission from this list indicates that confidentiality is not required._

==== FDP_SDI.2 Stored Data Integrity Monitoring and Action

FDP_SDI.2 Stored Data Integrity Monitoring and Action

FDP_SDI.2.1:: The TSF shall monitor *SDOs and SDEs* controlled by the TSF for [_integrity errors_] on all objects, based on the following attributes: [.underline]#*[selection: [_assignment: attribute associated with presence in protected storage_], cryptographic hash, digital signature, integrity-providing encryption algorithm as specified in FCS_COP.1/KeyWrap]*#.

FDP_SDI.2.2:: Upon detection of a data integrity error, the TSF shall [
+
* _prohibit the use of the altered data_
* _send notification of the error where applicable_].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This SFR deals with the mechanism that protects the integrity of the SDEs and security attributes within an SDO. This provides the binding data that ensures the prevention of unauthorized changes to the SDEs and attributes._
+
_The cryptographic requirements for cryptographic hashes and digital signatures apply here._
+
_No specific requirement is placed here on the nature of the integrity protection data, but the Security Target shall describe this protection measure, and shall identify the iteration of FCS_COP.1/Hash or FCS_COP.1/KeyedHash that covers any cryptographic algorithm used._
+
_The integrity protection data in FDP_SDI.2.1 is included in the list of attributes identified in FMT_MSA.1, and protects the value of the SDEs and of the SDO security attributes._
+
_When an SDO is parsed, its integrity is checked when it is imported into the TOE._

=== Identification and Authentication

When a platform process requests the ability to create, use, modify, dispose of, etc., an SDE or SDO within the DSC, as a matter of policy, the DSC may expect or request authorization from the platform process, which may include authentication of the requester on whose behalf the platform process is acting. The DSC assumes the requester to be either a person, a process, or a device. The rules on how the requester formats the request will be outside the scope of this cPP. Upon request (or as a matter of an established protocol), the interface (on behalf of the user) presents to the DSC process those authorization values required to authorize execution of the event request. This may include one or more different types of authentication credentials. The DSC validates these items before acting upon the requested event. The validation may simply compare the authorization values to an expected value, or perform a more complex cryptographic protocol to verify the authenticity of the user. After validation, the DSC may then create and subsequently use an authorization value to represent the validation of these authorization values in anticipation of future requests.

Requirements related to the strength, quality, and performance of authorization values supplied to the DSC, such as X.509 certificates and biometric templates, are all outside the scope of the DSC and are expected to be met by the platform, where applicable. The DSC is only expected to enforce quality metrics on any authorization values it generates itself.

==== FIA_AFL_EXT.1 Authorization Failure Handling

FIA_AFL_EXT.1 Authorization Failure Handling

FIA_AFL_EXT.1.1:: The TSF shall maintain [.underline]#[selection: a unique counter for [selection, choose one of: each SDO, the following SDOs [_assignment: list of SDOs_]], one global counter covering [selection, choose one of: all SDOs, the following SDOs [_assignment: list of SDOs_]]]#, called the failed authorization attempt counters, that counts of the number of unsuccessful authorization attempts that occur related to authorizing access to these *SDOs*.

FIA_AFL_EXT.1.2:: The TSF shall maintain a [.underline]#[selection, choose one of: static, administrator configurable variable]# threshold of the minimal acceptable number of unsuccessful authorization attempts that occur related to authorizing access to these *SDOs*.

FIA_AFL_EXT.1.3:: When the failed authorization attempt counters [.underline]#[selection, choose one of: meets, surpasses]# the threshold for unsuccessful authorization attempts, the TSF shall [.underline]#[selection, choose one of:#
+
* [.underline]#prevent future authorization attempts for a static prescribed amount of time;# 
* [.underline]#prevent future authorization attempts for an administrator configurable amount of time;#
* [.underline]#prevent all future authorization attempts indefinitely (i.e., lock), as described by FIA_AFL_EXT.2;#
* [.underline]#factory reset the TOE wiping out all non-persistent SDOs, as described by FDP_FRS_EXT.2#
+
] for these *SDOs*.

FIA_AFL_EXT.1.4:: The TSF shall increment the failed authorization attempt counter before it verifies the authorization.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _The product validates the authorization factors prior to determining whether user (administrator or client application) access to the SDE/SDO is permitted. In cases where validation of the authorization factors fails, the product will not allow access to SDE/SDO. The product validates the authorization factors in such a way that it does not allow an attacker to circumvent the other requirements to gain knowledge about the SDE/SDO or other keying material that protects them from inadvertent exposure._
+
_It is possible for the TOE to have different rules for the treatment of different SDOs or groups of SDOs. For example, some SDOs may trigger a factory reset in the event of excessive authorization failures while others may only temporarily block future authorization attempts. The ST author should iterate this SFR for each distinct response the TSF can make (as defined by the selections in FIA_AFL_EXT.1.3) and the SDOs whose authorization failures will trigger these responses._
+
_If [.underline]#prevent all future authorization attempts indefinitely (i.e., lock), as described by FIA_AFL_EXT.2# is selected in FIA_AFL_EXT.1.3, the selection-based SFR FIA_AFL_EXT.2 must be claimed._
+
_If [.underline]#factory reset the TOE wiping out all non-persistent SDOs, as described by FDP_FRS_EXT.2# is selected in FIA_AFL_EXT.1.3, the selection-based SFR FDP_FRS_EXT.2 must be claimed._

==== FIA_SOS.2 TSF Generation of Secrets

FIA_SOS.2 TSF Generation of Secrets

FIA_SOS.2.1:: The TSF shall provide a mechanism to generate *authorization data* that meet [_the following quality metrics:_
+
* _For each authentication attempt, the probability shall be less than one in 1,000,000 that a random attempt will be successful_
* _For multiple attempts to authenticate during a one-minute period, the probability shall be less than one in 100,000 that a series of random attempts will be successful_].

FIA_SOS.2.2:: The TSF shall be able to enforce the use of TSF generated *authorization data* for [_assignment: non-empty list of TSF functions_].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This SFR expects the TSF must generate authorization data from a sufficiently large key space to ensure that users cannot employ random guessing as a statistically plausible method of authorizing actions within the TOE, both for a single event and over a session._

==== FIA_UAU.2 User Authentication before Any Action

FIA_UAU.2 User Authentication before Any Action

FIA_UAU.2.1:: The TSF shall require each user *and SDO owner* to be successfully authenticated before *authorizing* any [.line-through]#other# TSF-mediated actions on behalf of that user *or SDO owner*.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This SFR goes with FDP_ACF.1, which authorizes access to SDOs (i.e. authorizes operations with or on SDOs). The security policies in FDP_ACF.1 may require authentication of the subjects and owners of the SDOs before the TSF authorizes access to them. An authentication token is critical data bound to a user. Such data, when presented to the TOE and successfully verified by it, authenticates the user. The TOE may use the successful authentication of a user as an authorization to execute an action on its behalf, or to perform a requested operation on or with an SDO._
+
_This requirement specifies the TSF exercise an authentication mechanism from FIA_UAU.5 by which the TOE authenticates the identity of the user requesting the operation and the owner of the SDO which is an object in the operation. Such authentication is necessary to authorize it to operate with the SDOs. A user could present a unique authentication token. The TSF may accept authentication tokens with no further conditioning. The TSF validates the authentication token prior to granting the authorization to perform the requested operation with the SDO. The SDO security attribute SDO.Reauth determines whether or not the TOE may authenticate the user and the SDO owner only once or each time each time it operates with the SDO._
+
_The means of validation may vary based on the type of authentication token._

==== FIA_UAU.5 Multiple Authentication Mechanisms

FIA_UAU.5 Multiple Authentication Mechanisms

FIA_UAU.5.1:: The TSF shall provide [.underline]#*[selection: none, authentication token mechanism, cryptographic signature mechanism, [_assignment: list of authentication mechanisms_]]*# to support user authentication.

FIA_UAU.5.2:: The TSF shall authenticate any user's claimed identity according to the [.underline]#*[selection: all subject users and SDO owners shall successfully authenticate themselves using one of the mechanisms listed in FIA_UAU.5.1, the Prove service shall not accept "none" as an authentication method, [_assignment: rules describing how each authentication mechanism provides authentication_]]*#.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This SFR describes the authentication mechanisms required for any user of any service as a precondition for providing authorization to execute the service. This includes the authentication of the owner of the SDOs of the service._

==== FIA_UAU.6 Re-Authenticating

FIA_UAU.6 Re-Authenticating

FIA_UAU.6.1:: The TSF shall re-authenticate the user *for access to an SDO* under the conditions: [
+
. _Re-authentication and re-authorization by further successful completion of the authentication and authorization methods in FIA_UAU.2, in accordance with the value of the SDO.Reauth attribute of the SDO as follows:_
+
[type=a]
.. _If SDO.Reauth has the value 'each access';_
.. _if SDO.Reauth has the value 'policy' and the TSF determines that the TOE satisfies the policy for re-authentication and reauthorization_
+
].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _The allowed values for the SDO.Reauth attribute of an SDO are defined in FMT_MSA.3 and the SDO Attributes Initialization Table. The rules in FDP_ACF.1.2 and also ensure that the need for re-authorization has been checked before access to an SDO._
+
_An SDO.Reauth value of 'none' indicates that no authentication of the subject user nor of the SDO owners is necessary. It also indicates that no reauthorization for operations using the SDO is necessary._
+
_An SDO.Reauth value of policy indicates that there may be a more complicated set of circumstances that trigger a re-auth (re-authentication of the users and owners as well as re-authorization of the operation). This could be a policy of a time limit for which a user can use an SDO before re-authentication (e.g. 10 minutes or 24 hours). The ST should indicate the policies allowed, and how the TOE evaluates the policies. The ST should also indicate the location of those policies, and how the TOE protects the integrity of those policies._
+
_When the TSF binds a user to access an SDO, this means that the TSF has authenticated the user and that the TSF authorized the user to have the right to exercise one or more of the following actions: generate the SDO, modify the SDO, including its security attributes, use the SDO in a TOE operation, propagate or duplicate the SDO for use by a device external to the DSC, or destroy the SDO. The user may not have exclusive rights to exercise the operations listed._
+
_Policy as represented by the attributes in the SDO dictates whether or not a user must authenticate itself in order to authorize access to the SDO._
+
_It is possible that the attributes of some SDOs should remain unchanged, and that the attributes of other SDOs may be changed by authorized users. If this is the case, then the ST author should iterate this SFR and indicate in the TSS which SDOs apply to each iteration._

=== Security Management

==== FMT_MOF_EXT.1 Management of Security Functions Behavior

FMT_MOF_EXT.1 Management of Security Functions Behavior

FMT_MOF_EXT.1.1:: The TSF shall restrict the ability to perform the functions in FMT_SMF.1 to authenticated administrators.

==== FMT_MSA.1 Management of Security Attributes

FMT_MSA.1 Management of Security Attributes

FMT_MSA.1.1:: The TSF shall enforce the [_Access Control SFP_] to restrict the ability to [.underline]#[modify]# the security attributes *[_assignment: list of security attributes, to include attributes as specified in <<SDOAttrib>>_] to [_the authorized identified roles as specified in <<SDOAttrib>>_]*.

_Only authorized subjects can change the attributes of an SDO, and only as permitted in <<SDOAttrib>>._

==== FMT_MSA.3 Static Attribute Initialization

This SFR deals with the initialization of the attributes of an SDO when it is created by parsing or provisioning. The generation process includes SDOs created by the TSF (provisioned) and those imported via FDP_ITC_EXT.2 (parsed).

The TSF is expected to give an SDO a set of security attributes at the time of its creation. This set is expected to include at least the following attributes:

* SDO identifier
* SDO type
* SDO reference authorization data (i.e. the data that is used when determining whether to grant access to an SDO, for each relevant mode of access, on the basis of an authorization token presented to the DSC)
* Re-authorization conditions (i.e. event after which re-authorization is required) 
* Confidential-SDE list (each SDE in this list is held encrypted when the SDO is stored)
* Export Flag (indicating whether the SDO is allowed to be propagated)
* Integrity protection data
* Binding Data (created by the TOE to strongly link or associate the SDO with other entities such as the TOE itself or with other SDOs in a hierarchy such as a child to a parent).

The TSF provides the capability to protect the contents of an SDO (i.e. the set of its SDEs together with the SDO attributes) from unauthorized modification. The DSC shall check for such modifications before using the SDO or any of its SDEs.

FMT_MSA.3 Static Attribute Initialization

FMT_MSA.3.1:: The TSF shall enforce the [_Access Control SFP_] to provide [.underline]#[selection, choose one of: restrictive, permissive, [_assignment: other property_]]# default values for security attributes that are used to enforce the SFP.

FMT_MSA.3.2:: The TSF shall allow the [_authorized identified roles, according to <<SDOAttribInit>>_] to specify alternative initial values to override the default values when an object or information is created.

:xrefstyle: basic

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _Both admin and client application roles can initiate the import process. The imported object contains the default values for each attribute, where allowed. The TSF can override default values for the following attributes of imported objects: SDO.ID, SDO.Type, SDO.Reauth, SDO.Export, and SDO.Integrity. The TSF may override default values in these cases to force the objects to comport to established structures within the TOE, or to comply with TOE-wide security policies. In these cases, the defined roles (i.e. admin and client application) cannot override the default values. For SDO.AuthData, the TSF shall allow user roles (i.e. admin and client applications) to override authorization data that may arrive with the object. For SDO.Conf the TSF accepts the imported value for this attribute. SDO.Bind is explained below._
+
_Unless otherwise noted, both admin and client application roles can initiate the generation process. The admin and client application will provide the default values for the attributes. This SFR assumes the TSF checks SDO.Type, SDO.AuthData, SDO.Reauth, SDO.Conf, and SDO.Export for compliance with established security policies and refuses to create objects which do not comply and thus will not override the value of any of these attributes. In the cases of the SDO.ID and SDO.Integrity, the TSF generates these values and therefore there is no need to override._
+
_In the case of SDO.Bind for both import and generation processes, the TSF may override values that denote a binding to the TOE, but it should not override values that denote a binding to other keys. In the case of the import process, the defined roles cannot override the default values for any binding._
+
_The <<SDOAttribInit>> Table is referenced from FMT_MSA.3 and matches the attributes covered by FMT_MSA.1 (which defines controls on the modification of the attributes). The initialization of these security attributes occurs when an SDO is either parsed by the TOE or generated on the TOE. The required constraints on security attribute initialization specified in this PP are shown in the <<SDOAttribInit>> Table; the Security Target completes the selection and assignments in the SFR and adds to the table any other information for other security attributes relevant to a particular TOE._
+
_The SDO.AuthData attribute is data that is required in order to validate authorization of a subject to access the SDO (in each of the modes relevant to that SDO). The nature of this data will depend on the authorization mechanism used in the TOE, as described in FIA_UAU.2._
+
_The SDO.Reauth attribute for an individual SDO takes one of the values defined in the selection in the Allowed Values column of the <<SDOAttribInit>> Table. Examples of TOE-specified events might be explicit revocation of authorization by a user, expiry of a time interval, or completion of a fixed number of uses since the last authorization. The re-authorization conditions are used in FIA_UAU.6 and FDP_ACF.1. These determine whether a single authorization by the SDO owner will allow any number of uses of the SDO until the end of the user's session (value 'none'), or whether each use of the SDO must be individually authorized (value 'each access'), or whether re-authorization must happen each time one of the TOE-specified events occurs._
+
_The SDO.Conf attribute indicates which SDEs, if any, the TOE should encrypt when not in operational use. The TOE should use the methods in FCS_COP.1/SKC, FCS_STG_EXT.1, or FCS_STG_EXT.2 to protect the SDEs in this list._
+
_The SDO.Export attribute takes one of the values 'exportable' or 'non-exportable'._
+
_The SDO.Integrity attribute includes evidence that the TSF can use to protect and verify the integrity of the SDO._
+
_Attributes assigned by the TOE to any parsed SDOs must be described in the Security Target and in operational user guidance._
+
_The TOE uses the Binding Data for an SDO to strongly link the SDO to the TOE, a parent SDO in a hierarchy, or to nothing at all. SDOs bound to nothing may freely travel from one TOE to another without restrictions. If bound to another SDO as a child to a parent in a hierarchy, it may travel only where the parent SDO travels. If bound to the TOE, it may travel to any other TOE for any reason, even if the TOE moves its parent to another TOE. Note that vendors will initialize attributes of pre-installed SDOs with default values. However, authorization values to change the attributes of pre-installed SDOs may differ from the authorization value required to use the pre-installed SDO._
+
_The vendor should document the implicit attributes for pre-installed SDOs and SDOs stored in special locations._
+
_In cases in which the SDO ID is a cryptographic hash of the attributes and SDEs, that value represents both the ID and projects the integrity of the SDO, including the SDEs. As the TOE unwraps an incoming SDO, it may automatically check the integrity. For pre-installed SDOs in protected storage, the hardware plus the TSF projects the integrity of them._
+
_When a remote peer sends an SDO to the TOE, it properly indicates through the SDE-confidentiality list of any authorization values and authentication tokens present in the SDO, whether they are present in the SDE or as attributes, which control access to the SDE._
+
_When a TOE generates an SDO internally for the first time, it properly indicates through the SDE-confidentiality list any SDEs that are authorization values or authentication tokens. Similarly, if any of the attributes are authorization values or authentication tokens, the TOE will properly indicate through the SDE-confidentiality list that it will encrypt them prior to storing them._
+
_The TOE may contain pre-installed SDOs or SDOs either provisioned the first time the user turns on the TOE or provisioned as the result of a "factory reset" event. TSFs may refer to such persistent SDOs as root keys or trusted anchors. Pre-installed SDOs may reside in immutable hardware and persist across factory resets. Other persistent SDOs may persist until a user issues a "factory reset" which either cryptographically erases the SDOs or overwrites them by provisioning new ones. These SDOs may not contain a confidential SDE list since either these persistent values serve as a root encryption key for a hierarchy of SDOs, or they serve as a KDF seed for generating root encryption keys for a hierarchy of SDOs._
+
_It is possible that the default attributes of some SDOs should be restrictive, and that the default attributes of other SDOs may be permissive. If this is the case, then the ST author should iterate this SFR and indicate in the TSS what the default attribute properties are for each SDO._
+
_Policy as represented by the attributes in the SDO dictates whether or not a user must authenticate itself in order to authorize access to the SDO._
+
_It is possible that the attributes of some SDOs should remain unchanged, and that the attributes of other SDOs may be changed by authorized users. If this is the case, then the ST author should iterate this SFR and indicate in the TSS which SDOs apply to each iteration._

==== FMT_SMF.1 Specification of Management Functions

FMT_SMF.1 Specification of Management Functions

FMT_SMF.1.1:: The TSF shall be capable of performing the following management functions: [
+
* _Set authorization failure parameters for FIA_AFL_EXT.1_
* _Reset TOE to factory state for FDP_FRS_EXT.1_
* _Configure authorization policies for TOE resources_
+
_[.underline]#[selection:#_
+
** _[.underline]#update TOE firmware and pre-installed SDOs,#_
** _[.underline]#unlock access to SDO following excessive failed authorization attempts,#_
** _[.underline]#no other functions]#_].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _If FDP_MFW_EXT.1 selects [.underline]#mutable firmware#, then FMT_SMF.1 must select [.underline]#Update TOE firmware and pre-installed SDOs#._
+
_Recall that resetting a TOE to factory state also wipes all user data, but may not wipe out pre-installed SDOs. Configuring authorization policies includes setting policies for allowed access to SDOs._
+
_Protections for pre-installed SDEs/SDOs come through the firmware, and by extension, through firmware updates. In the same vein, the authorized updates may also affect the SDEs as well, if the vendor so chooses. One could say that the authorized update binds the attributes present in the functionality of the firmware to the pre-installed SDEs._

==== FMT_SMR.1 Security Roles

FMT_SMR.1 Security Roles

FMT_SMR.1.1:: The TSF shall maintain the roles: [_administrator, client application_].

FMT_SMR.1.2:: The TSF shall be able to associate users with roles.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This cPP uses the term "user" throughout to reference both the administrator and client application roles simultaneously._

=== Protection of the TSF

==== FPT_FLS.1/FI Failure with Preservation of Secure State (Fault Injection)

FPT_FLS.1/FI Failure with Preservation of Secure State (Fault Injection)

FPT_FLS.1.1/FI:: The TSF shall preserve a secure state when the following types of failures occur: [_fault injections_].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _Note that a secure state does not imply the uninterrupted enforcement of all claimed security functionality it is appropriate for the TSF to "fail closed" and block the execution of security-relevant behavior if a fault injection attempt or other significant glitch occurs._

==== FPT_MOD_EXT.1 Debug Modes

FPT_MOD_EXT.1 Debug Modes

FPT_MOD_EXT.1.1:: The TSF shall provide no access to debug modes.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: '_Debug modes' may include, but are not limited to, any alternate mode of operation, such as developer mode, test mode, manufacturer mode, or altered boot mode. These modes may be available in some versions of the TOE, but not in the final production version._

==== FPT_PHP.3 Resistance to Physical Attack

FPT_PHP.3 Resistance to Physical Attack

FPT_PHP.3.1:: The TSF shall resist [_data extraction via fault injection from extreme temperatures and abnormal voltage_] to the {empty}[_TSF storage elements that contain [.underline]#[selection: SDEs, SDOs, firmware]#_] by responding automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _Physical protection mechanisms as envisioned by this requirement are mechanisms that protect communications to the extent that encryption or other logical protections are not required to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and assured identification of endpoints. Such mechanisms may include, for example, physically isolated traces, or mechanisms that take advantage of physical properties of signals to ensure that communications are receivable only by the intended endpoint._
+
_Any physical external casing or potting material of the TOE is considered an 'external interface', not just those interfaces over which data is transmitted. This ensures that the TSF will respond appropriately if, for example, an attacker penetrates the physical surface of the DSC in an attempt to access its stored data._
+
_The TOE's protection against abnormal temperature and voltage can be considered equivalent to what is required by assertion AS07.77 of [ISO-TR]._

==== FPT_PRO_EXT.1 Root of Trust

FPT_PRO_EXT.1 Root of Trust

FPT_PRO_EXT.1.1:: The TSF shall contain an SDO that contains the identity of the Root of Trust.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _Every DSC is expected to have a single RoT that comprises the DSC hardware and pre-installed SDOs, from which services (e.g. Storage, Authorization, etc.) can be offered._
+
_Depending on the use case and the way status registers are used, unique identity keys may be bound to the TOE, the TOE platform, or both._
+
_The sole presence of unique identity keys linking to the RoT does not prove authenticity without the use of digital signatures._

FPT_PRO_EXT.1.2:: The TSF shall maintain Root of Trust data as [.underline]#[selection: immutable, mutable if and only if its mutability is controlled by a unique identifiable owner]#.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _One expects that only authorized sources can modify the single RoT, such as through a secure update. A pre-installed SDO may contain the identity of the manufacturer of the RoT._
+
_The process of authenticating the source of a secure update may involve querying the identity of the manufacturer, contained on a pre-installed SDO. If this identity is in the form of an X.509 certificate containing a signature verification key signed by the manufacturer, then the authentication process is sufficient._
+
_A unique identifiable owner is assumed to be one with an administrative role; however, there may be circumstances where the owner does not take on an administrative role, which should be documented._

==== FPT_ROT_EXT.1 Root of Trust Services

FPT_ROT_EXT.1 Root of Trust Services

FPT_ROT_EXT.1.1:: The TSF shall provide a Root of Trust for Storage, a Root of Trust for Authorization, and [.underline]#[selection: Root of Trust for Measurement, Root of Trust for Reporting, no others]#.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This document uses the [GP_ROT] definitions for RoT for Storage (denoted as the combination of RoT for Confidentiality and RoT for Integrity), Authorization, Measurement, and Reporting. DSCs use Roots of Trust for Storage to protect SDOs. Section 6.5 has a number of requirements for ensuring the TSF has functionality to authorize a user in order to access an SDO, including FIA_UAU.6._
+
_If both [.underline]#Root of Trust for Measurement# and [.underline]#Root of Trust for Reporting# are selected in FPT_ROT_EXT.1.1, the selection-based SFR FDP_DAU.1/Prove must also be claimed._

==== FPT_ROT_EXT.2 Root of Trust for Storage

FPT_ROT_EXT.2 Root of Trust for Storage

FPT_ROT_EXT.2.1:: The TSF shall prevent unauthorized access to SDOs associated with the Root of Trust for Storage.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _TOEs may use shielded locations or cryptographic protections to prevent unauthorized access to SDOs. Use FDP_SDI.2 to protect the integrity of SDOs stored in the RoT for Storage._

==== FPT_RPL.1/Authorization Replay Prevention

FPT_RPL.1/Authorization Replay Prevention

FPT_RPL.1.1/Authorization:: The TSF shall detect replay for the following entities: [_user authorization of operations on SDOs_].

FPT_RPL.1.2/Authorization:: The TSF shall perform [_denial of the requested operation on the SDO_] when a replay is detected *using the following methods [.underline]#[selection: monotonic counters, random nonces, [_assignment: other methods as specified_]]#*.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _The TSF receives authorization from an external source to the DSC to perform an operation on an SDO. If the operation on the SDO is restricted to authorized users, then anyone observing the communication to the DSC can copy the authorization and replay it. Random nonces and monotonic counters are but two mechanisms the TSF can use to mitigate replay. In this requirement, operations on SDOs include generating, using, modifying, propagating, and destroying. Besides monotonic counters and random nonces, the TSF could employ other methods to prevent replay of user authorizations, which the Security Target should describe._

==== FPT_STM.1 Reliable Time Stamps

FPT_STM.1 Reliable Time Stamps

FPT_STM.1.1:: The TSF shall be able to provide reliable time stamps.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _It is acceptable for the TSF to provide timestamp data either through an internal clock or a counter. It is also permissible for the TSF to obtain time data from a clock contained within the same physical enclosure in which the TOE is embedded (e.g. a mobile device)._

==== FPT_TST.1 TSF Testing

FPT_TST.1 TSF Testing

FPT_TST.1.1:: The TSF shall run a suite of self tests *during power-on start-up*, [.underline]#[selection: periodically during normal operation, at the request of the authorized user, *at no other condition,* at the conditions [_assignment: conditions under which self test should occur_]]# to demonstrate the correct operation of [the TSF].

FPT_TST.1.2:: The TSF shall provide authorized users with the capability to verify the integrity of [.underline]#[TSF data]#.

FPT_TST.1.3:: The TSF shall provide authorized users with the capability to verify the integrity of *the* [.underline]#[TSF]#.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This requirement intends to cover integrity of the TSF functionality (i.e. runtime checks)._
+
_TSF integrity testing provides the ability to test the TSF's correct operation. These tests are expected to be performed automatically and autonomously at start-up but may also be performed periodically during operation, at the request of the authorized user, or when other conditions are met. It also provides the ability to verify the integrity of TSF data and executable code._
+
_All cryptographic functions come with known answer tests (KATs). In addition to verifying the integrity of the firmware executing the TSF, the DSC should also verify the integrity of any data associated with the TSF (such as constants for cryptographic algorithms) as well as performing the KATs._

=== Resource Utilization

==== FRU_FLT.1 Degraded Fault Tolerance

FRU_FLT.1 Degraded Fault Tolerance

FRU_FLT.1.1:: The TSF shall ensure the operation of [_protection of TSF data_] when the following failures occur: [_fault injection_].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _TSF data may be protected in response to a fault injection either by providing a method to ensure that the data remains protected or by logically destroying the data or any part of a key chain that encrypts it. This behavior may differ based on the type of fault._

== Security Assurance Requirements

This cPP identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs independent testing.

This section lists the set of SARs from CC part 3 that are required in evaluations against this cPP. Individual Evaluation Activities to be performed are specified in [SD].

The general model for evaluation of TOEs against STs written to conform to this cPP is as follows:

After the ST has been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF will obtain the TOE, supporting environmental IT (if required), and the administrative/user guides for the TOE. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) and the Evaluation Activities contained within the SD. 

The actions for ALC Class (ALC_CMC.1 and ALC_CMS.1) are specified solely within the CEM, while the remaining Assurance Classes are extended beyond the CEM as described in the SD. The SD is intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the TOE. The Evaluation Activities that are captured in the SD also provide clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant with the cPP.

|===

=== ASE: Security Target

The ST is evaluated as per ASE activities defined in the CEM. In addition, there may be Evaluation Activities specified within the SD that call for necessary descriptions to be included in the TSS that are specific to the TOE technology type.

In addition to using the ST to demonstrate that ASE_TSS.1 has been satisfied, this cPP requires the creation of supplemental documentation to justify how the TOE satisfies certain SFRs. This documentation is separated from the ST because the required level of detail may include information that is proprietary to the developer of the TOE. The required supplemental documentation includes entropy documentation and key management documentation. The requirements for the entropy documentation are described in <<Entropy Documentation and Assessment>> of this cPP. The requirements for the key management documentation are described in the SD under the SFRs that require a detailed description of the TSF's key management.

=== ADV: Development
:xrefstyle: short
The design information about the TOE is contained in the guidance documentation available to the end user as well as the TSS portion of the ST, and any additional information required by this cPP that is not to be made public (e.g., Entropy Essay). The DSC cPP requires only basic functional specification of interfaces presented in the AGD documentation (see <<Basic Functional Specification (ADV_FSP.1)>>) and specification of interfaces that can be invoked by a dependent component in a composed evaluation where the DSC is the base component.
:xrefstyle: full

==== Basic Functional Specification (ADV_FSP.1)

The functional specification describes the TOE Security Functions Interfaces (TSFIs). It is not necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. For this cPP, the Evaluation Activities for this family focus on understanding the interfaces presented in the TSS in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces presented in the AGD documentation.

The Evaluation Activities in the SD are associated with the applicable SFRs; since these are directly associated with the SFRs, the tracing in element ADV_FSP.1.2D is implicitly already done and no additional documentation is necessary.

==== Specification of DSC Interface for Use in Composite Evaluations

For the DSC to serve as a base component in a composed evaluation, all DSC interfaces that may be invoked by a dependent component to satisfy dependent component SFRs must be documented.

A DSC that complies with this cPP must make services available to a dependent component through interfaces. The DSC ST author must describe these interfaces in order for a dependent component evaluation to properly map the DSC-provided services to SFRs within the dependent component PP, and to ensure that dependent component implementations properly use the service interfaces.

The Evaluation Activities in the SD require specifying each such interface exported.

=== AGD: Guidance Documentation

The guidance documents will be provided with the ST. Guidance must include a description of how the IT personnel verifies that the Operational Environment can fulfill its role for the security functionality. The documentation should be in an informal style and readable by the IT personnel.

Guidance must be provided for every operational environment that the product supports as claimed in the ST. This guidance includes:

* instructions to successfully install the TSF in that environment; and
* instructions to manage the security of the TSF as a product and as a component of the larger operational environment; and
* Instructions to provide a protected administrative capability.

Guidance pertaining to particular security functionality must also be provided; requirements on such guidance are contained in the Evaluation Activities specified in the SD.

==== Operational User Guidance (AGD_OPE.1)

The operational user guidance does not have to be contained in a single document. Guidance to users, administrators and application developers can be spread among documents or web pages.

The developer should review the Evaluation Activities contained in the SD to ascertain the specifics of the guidance that the evaluator will be checking for. This will provide the necessary information for the preparation of acceptable guidance.

==== Preparative Procedures (AGD_PRE.1)

As with the operational guidance, the developer should look to the Evaluation Activities to determine the required content with respect to preparative procedures.

=== Class ALC: Life-cycle Support

At the assurance level provided for TOEs conformant to this cPP, life-cycle support is limited to end-user-visible aspects of the life cycle, rather than an examination of the TOE vendor's development and configuration management process. This is not meant to diminish the critical role that a developer's practices play in contributing to the overall trustworthiness of a product; rather, it is a reflection on the information to be made available for evaluation at this assurance level.

==== Labelling of the TOE (ALC_CMC.1)

This component is targeted at identifying the TOE such that it can be distinguished from other products or versions from the same vendor and can be easily specified when being procured by an end user. The evaluator performs the CEM work units associated with ALC_CMC.1

==== TOE CM Coverage (ALC_CMS.1)

Given the scope of the TOE and its associated evaluation evidence requirements, the evaluator performs the CEM work units associated with ALC_CMS.1.

=== Class ATE: Tests

Testing is specified for functional aspects of the system as well as aspects that take advantage of design or implementation weaknesses. The former is done through the ATE_IND family, while the latter is through the AVA_VAN family. For this cPP, testing is based on advertised functionality and interfaces with dependency on the availability of design information. One of the primary outputs of the evaluation process is the test report as specified in the following requirement.

==== Independent Testing - Conformance (ATE_IND.1)
:xrefstyle: short
Testing is performed to confirm the functionality described in the TSS as well as the operational guidance (includes "evaluated configuration" instructions). The focus of the testing is to confirm that the requirements specified in <<Security Functional Requirements>> are being met. The Evaluation Activities in the SD identify the specific testing activities necessary to verify compliance with the SFRs. The evaluator produces a test report documenting the plan for and results of testing, as well as coverage arguments focused on the platform/TOE combinations that are claiming conformance to this cPP.
:xrefstyle: full

=== Class AVA: Vulnerability Assessment

For the current generation of this cPP, the iTC is expected to survey open sources to discover what vulnerabilities have been discovered in these types of products and provide that content into the AVA_VAN discussion. In most cases, these vulnerabilities will require sophistication beyond that of a basic attacker. This information will be used in the development of future Protection Profiles.

==== Vulnerability Survey (AVA_VAN.1)

As with ATE_IND, the evaluator shall generate a report to document their findings with respect to this requirement. This report could physically be part of the overall test report mentioned in ATE_IND, or a separate document. The evaluator performs a search of public information to determine the vulnerabilities that have been found in components similar to the component under evaluation (such as a secure element) and when applicable, implemented communication protocols in general, as well as those that pertain to the particular TOE. The evaluator documents the sources consulted and the vulnerabilities found in the report. For each vulnerability found, the evaluator either provides a rationale with respect to its non-applicability, or the evaluator formulates a test (using the guidelines provided in ATE_IND) to confirm the vulnerability, if suitable. Suitability is determined by assessing the attack vector needed to take advantage of the vulnerability. If exploiting the vulnerability requires expert skills and an electron microscope, for instance, then a test would not be suitable and an appropriate justification would be formulated.

== Optional Requirements
=== Cryptographic Support
==== FCS_RBG.2 Random Bit Generation (External Seeding)

FCS_RBG.2 Random Bit Generation (External Seeding)

FCS_RBG.2.1:: The TSF shall be able to accept a minimum input of [*assignment*: _minimum input length greater than zero_] from a TSF interface for the purpose of seeding.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _The TSF accepts enough input from an external noise source to satisfy the entropy requirements of the DRBG. The TSF should also protect the integrity and confidentiality of the entropy it receives from the external noise source._

==== FCS_RBG.3 Random Bit Generation (Internal Seeding - Single Source)

FCS_RBG.3 Random Bit Generation (Internal Seeding - Single Source)

FCS_RBG.3.1:: The TSF shall be able to seed the RBG using a [*selection*: choose one of: _TSF software-based noise source, TSF hardware-based noise source_] [*assignment*: _name of noise source_] with a minimum of [*assignment*: _number of bits_] bits of min-entropy. 

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _If an ST Author wishes to use multiple internal noise sources, they iterate this requirement for each noise source used by the TSF._
+
_Hardware-based noise sources are entropy sources whose primary function is noise generation, such as ring oscillators, diodes, and thermal noise. While a TOE may use software to collect the noise from these hardware sources, these are not software-based. Software-based noise sources are those sources that have some other primary function, and the noise is a byproduct of their normal operation. Examples of software-based noise sources are user or system-based events, reading the least significant bits from an event timer, etc._
+
_Hardware-based noise sources may be stochastically modelled, in which case the amount of entropy is well understood. Software-based noise sources are usually less well understood and therefore will typically take a more conservative approach, gathering larger numbers of bits than required and then performing a compression function to derive the final output. Software-based noise sources often rely on an entropy estimator._

==== FCS_RBG.4 Random Bit Generation (Internal Seeding - Multiple Sources)

FCS_RBG.4 Random Bit Generation (Internal Seeding - Multiple Sources)

FCS_RBG.4.1:: The TSF shall be able to seed the RBG using [*selection*: _[*assignment*: number] TSF software-based noise source(s), [*assignment*: number] TSF hardware-based noise source(s)_].

==== FCS_RBG.5 Random Bit Generation (Combining Noise Sources)

FCS_RBG.5 Random Bit Generation (Combining Noise Sources)

FCS_RBG.5.1:: The TSF shall [*selection*: _concatenate, xor_] [*selection*: _output from TSF noise source(s), input from TSF interface(s) for seeding_] to create the entropy input into the derivation function as defined in [*assignment*: _list of standards_], resulting in a minimum of [*assignment*: _number of bits_] bits of min-entropy. 

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _One can apply 800-90B (or AIS-31) statistical tests against internal noise sources (a.k.a. raw entropy) to confirm the min-entropy of the noise sources either in aggregate or individually. One should not apply 800-90B (or AIS-31) statistical tests against external noise sources since the TOE is unable to enforce entropy requirements or conditioning requirements against external sources of entropy. However, the TSS may include estimates for min-entropy from external sources that contribute to the overall entropy requirements for either the DRBG or for FCS_OTV_EXT.1._
+
_FCS_RBG.5 specifies the combining operation such that the combined min-entropy of all the internal sources and the estimated entropy of the external sources is greater than or equal to the desired entropy of the output of the combining operation. The output could be used as a nonce, or a seed for a DRBG. The combining operation should avoid crushing the entropy of the sources such that the desired entropy of the output cannot be met._

==== FCS_RBG.6 Random Bit Generation Service

FCS_RBG.6 Random Bit Generation Service

FCS_RBG.6.1:: The TSF shall provide a [*selection*: _hardware, software,_ [*assignment*: _other interface type_]] interface to make the RBG output, as specified in FCS_RBG.1 Random Bit Generation (RBG), available as a service to entities outside of the TOE.

=== Protection of the TSF
==== FPT_ITT.1 Basic Internal TSF Data Transfer Protection

FPT_ITT.1 Basic Internal TSF Data Transfer Protection

FPT_ITT.1.1:: The TSF shall protect TSF data from [.underline]#[disclosure]# *and [.underline]#[selection: modification, no other actions]*# when it is transmitted between separate parts of the TOE.

==== FPT_PRO_EXT.2 Data Integrity Measurements

FPT_PRO_EXT.2 Data Integrity Measurements

FPT_PRO_EXT.2.1:: The TSF shall be able to quantify the integrity of the data protected by the TOE by generating integrity measurements and assertions making them available to authorized entities.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _The generation of these integrity measurements and assertions is the creation of OB.Pstate._
+
_Data protected by the TOE includes DSC firmware, DSC configuration data, and user data. DSC configuration data may include persistent SDEs or SDOs such as immutable or mutable root keys, authorization values, and authentication tokens (i.e. DSC.ID, OB.P_SDO, OB.FAACntr, OB.AntiReplay, and OB.Context). User data may include transient SDEs and SDOs as well as authorization values and authentication tokens bound to these SDEs and SDOs (i.e. OB.T_SDO). Integrity reporting is the process of attesting to integrity measurements (including those recorded in status registers in a DSC)._

FPT_PRO_EXT.2.2:: The TSF shall accumulate platform characteristics using a consistent [_assignment: description of process for accumulating platform characteristics_] process in which verified quantifiable measurements are accumulated to prove the integrity of its SDOs.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _Although a platform may enter any state possible—including undesirable or insecure states—it can use platform characteristics, including integrity measurements and assertions, along with logging and reporting to accurately report the state derived from data attributing to those states. In this context, platform characteristics can include, but is not limited to, cryptographic hashes of binary data, security-critical configurations, register values (including status registers) and milestones, such as verification of firmware, or transitioning from a boot phase to an operational phase. A platform characteristic may also represent the state of some entity outside the DSC. A process independent from the DSC or the host containing the DSC may evaluate the platform characteristics and determine an appropriate action._

==== FPT_ROT_EXT.3 Root of Trust for Reporting Mechanisms 

FPT_ROT_EXT.3 Root of Trust for Reporting Mechanisms

FPT_ROT_EXT.3.1:: The TSF shall be able to attest to a state as represented by platform characteristics with a Root of Trust for Reporting mechanism that uses for its identity [.underline]#[selection: a cryptographically verifiable identity in FPT_PRO_EXT.1, an alias key bound to the cryptographically verifiable identity in FPT_PRO_EXT.1]# and using a signature algorithm as specified in FCS_COP.1**/SigGen**.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _While it is possible for a group of components to share a single unique group identifier, it is important to ensure that individual components have their own unique identifiers relative to each other._
+
_Resident keys or aliases are designed such that they are never visible outside the subset of DSC scope containing the RoT services and are only to be used for encryption. Therefore, possession of such aliases or keys can only be proved indirectly by using it to decrypt a value that has been encrypted with a corresponding public key. In this way, these resident keys or aliases can provide for authentication based on decryption operations instead of producing a digital signature._
+
_If [.underline]#non-specialized cryptographic keys used for algorithms in FCS_COP# is selected, it is expected that when used in the context of the RoT for Reporting, these keys are not visible to full DSC scope as described above. While it is possible for a group of components to share a single unique group identifier, it is important to ensure that individual components have their own unique identifiers relative to each other._
+
_The DSC will not expose the private portions of resident keys or aliases outside the subset of DSC scope containing the RoT services. Therefore, possession of such aliases or keys can only be proved indirectly by using it to decrypt a value that has been encrypted with a corresponding public key. In this way, these resident keys or aliases can provide for authentication based on decryption operations instead of producing a digital signature._
+
_The DSC responds to requests from an external entity to attest to the provenance and integrity of platform characteristics contained within the DSC._
+
_Integrity reporting is the process of attesting to platform characteristics (including those recorded in status registers in a DSC). The philosophy behind integrity measurement, logging, and reporting is that a platform may enter any state possible—including undesirable or insecure states—but can still accurately report measurements derived from data attributing to those states. In this context, data can include, but is not limited to, code, security-critical configurations, values of registers, including status registers. An independent process may evaluate the integrity states and determine an appropriate response._

== Selection-Based Requirements

As indicated in the introduction to this cPP, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the TOE or its underlying platform) are contained in the body of this cPP. There are additional requirements based on selections in the body of the cPP: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements below will need to be included.

The TSF can perform conditioning using one of the identified hash functions or the process described in NIST SP 800-132; the ST author selects the method used. NIST SP 800-132 requires the use of a pseudo-random function (PRF) consisting of HMAC with an approved hash function._
+
_Appendix A of NIST SP 800-132 recommends setting the iteration count in order to increase the computation needed to derive a key from a password and, therefore, increase the workload of performing a dictionary attack._
+
_The TOE must claim this requirement if it claims FCS_CKM.1/SKG and selects an algorithm in the PBK row or claims FCS_CKM.5 and selects at least one of [.underline]#KeyDrv4#, [.underline]#KeyDrv5#, or [.underline]#KeyDrv6# AND uses password-based key derivation to create at least one of the inputs._
+
_If less than 1000 PBKDF iterations are used, the ST must specify the workload equivalence to at least 1000 PBKDF iterations._

=== User Data Protection
==== FDP_DAU.1/Prove Basic Data Authentication (for Use with The Prove Service)

FDP_DAU.1/Prove Basic Data Authentication (for Use with the Prove Service)

FDP_DAU.1.1/Prove:: The TSF shall provide a capability to generate evidence that can be used as a guarantee of the validity of [.underline]#[selection: [_assignment: list of objects or information types_] declared valid by the TSF, [_assignment: list of objects or information types_] declared valid by an authenticated user]#.

FDP_DAU.1.2/Prove:: The TSF shall provide [_assignment: list of subjects_] with the ability to verify evidence of the validity of the indicated information.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This SFR describes the output of the Prove service provided by the DSC. The evidence of validity or authenticity, or other evidence derived, is expected to be processed by the RoT for Measurement. Additionally, the use of a RoT for Reporting presupposes a logging capability or other means of generating state information that could be conveyed to external entities. Therefore, FDP_DAU.1.1/Prove must be selected if-and-only-if the RoT for Measurement and the RoT for Reporting are both selected in FPT_ROT_EXT.1.1. An 'authenticated user' in the sense of the selection in FDP_DAU.1.1/Prove means a user who has been authenticated by the DSC according to the mechanisms of FIA_UAU.5._
+
_In FDP_DAU.1.1/Prove, the DSC will issue a validity-stamped or authenticity-stamped piece of data. In this case, validity-stamped means that the form of the issued data enables an external entity to verify that the data has been issued via the DSC's Prove service. The implementation_ _might be via a DSC cryptographic signature, or a MAC using a symmetric key shared with the receiver, for example. Authenticity-stamped means that the receiver of the data can verify that the user providing this data is authentic._
+
_Data that would need to be validity-stamped includes data over which the DSC is the authority, such as the state of its own firmware. Data that would need to be authenticity-stamped includes data about which the DSC knows nothing, but where it will issue the data with a statement that the DSC has authenticated the source of this data._
+
_For data that is validity-stamped, the DSC does nothing but respond to a request to issue the data; thus, authentication of the user issuing the data is not needed and is covered by FDP_DAU.1/Prove. Otherwise, in the case the DSC has no understanding of this data, a step is needed via FIA_UAU.5 by which the DSC authenticates the user for this service, and that the DSC or Prove service will therefore vouch for the user, not the validity of the data itself._

==== FDP_FRS_EXT.2 Factory Reset Behavior

FDP_FRS_EXT.2 Factory Reset Behavior

FDP_FRS_EXT.2.1:: Upon initiation of a factory reset, the TSF shall destroy [_all non-persistent SDOs_] and restore the following *pre-installed SDOs* to their factory settings: [_assignment: pre-installed SDOs to be restored during a factory reset_].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _Not all DSCs permit a factory reset of the TOE, or perform a factory reset in response to excessive failed authentication or authorization attempts. Those that do are expected to perform a factory reset in a manner that prevents any inadvertent disclosure of security-relevant data that was present on the DSC prior to the factory reset. For DSCs that permit factory reset functionality (as indicated by selection of [.underline]#factory reset the TOE wiping out all non-persistent SDOs, as described by FDP_FRS_EXT.2# in FIA_AFL_EXT.1.3, or by [.underline]#no actions or conditions# NOT being selected in FDP_FRS_EXT.1.1), this SFR must be included in the TOE boundary._

==== FDP_MFW_EXT.2 Basic Firmware Integrity

FDP_MFW_EXT.2 Basic Firmware Integrity

FDP_MFW_EXT.2.1:: The TSF shall have the ability to verify the integrity of the firmware.

FDP_MFW_EXT.2.2:: The TSF shall provide a capability to generate evidence of the integrity of the firmware.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _Data and firmware integrity is not a required component of this cPP in all cases because some DSCs will have immutable firmware. This SFR must be claimed if [.underline]#mutable# is selected in FDP_MFW_EXT.1.1._
+
_The TOE guarantees the integrity of the firmware by verifying its integrity._
+
_Verifying the integrity of the firmware could be accomplished by guaranteeing the validity of firmware within the TOE prior to execution._
+
_This requirement covers the case of ensuring the firmware is trustworthy in immutable form or mutable through any firmware updates, since the integrity and authenticity are checked prior to execution._
+
_FCS_COP.1/SigVer applies if the TOE provides the capability to update the TOE firmware and uses digital signatures and MAC verification for update verification. The ST Author should choose the algorithm implemented to perform digital signatures. For the algorithms chosen, the ST author should make the appropriate assignments/selections to specify the parameters that are implemented for that algorithm._

==== FDP_MFW_EXT.3 Firmware Authentication with Identity of Guarantor

FDP_MFW_EXT.3 Firmware Authentication with Identity of Guarantor

FDP_MFW_EXT.3.1:: The TSF shall have the ability to verify the authenticity of the firmware.

FDP_MFW_EXT.3.2:: The TSF shall provide a capability to generate evidence of the authenticity of the firmware.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _Firmware authentication is not a required component of this cPP in all cases because some DSCs will have immutable firmware. This SFR must be claimed if [.underline]#mutable# is selected in FDP_MFW_EXT.1.1._
+
_The TOE guarantees the authenticity of the firmware by verifying its signature._
+
_Verifying the authenticity of the firmware could be accomplished by guaranteeing the validity of firmware within the TOE prior to execution._
+
_This requirement covers the case of ensuring the firmware is trustworthy in immutable form or mutable through any firmware updates, since the integrity and authenticity are checked prior to execution._

_FCS_COP.1/SigVer applies if the TOE provides the capability to update the TOE firmware and uses digital signatures and MAC verification for update verification. The ST Author should choose the algorithm implemented to perform digital signatures. For the algorithms chosen, the ST author should make the appropriate assignments/selections to specify the parameters that are implemented for that algorithm._

=== Identification and Authentication
==== FIA_AFL_EXT.2 Authorization Failure Response

FIA_AFL_EXT.2 Authorization Failure Response

FIA_AFL_EXT.2.1:: When the TSF locks an *SDO* (i.e. prevents authorization attempts for an *SDO*) due to a user exceeding the allowed threshold for unsuccessful authorization attempts, then only an administrator may unlock access to the *SDO* and reset the corresponding failed authorization attempt counter.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This SFR is applicable only when the TSF's response to excessive authorization failures selects [.underline]#prevent all future authorization attempts indefinitely (i.e., lock)# as specified by FIA_AFL_EXT.1.3._

=== Protection of the TSF
==== FPT_FLS.1/FW Failure with Preservation of Secure State (Firmware)

FPT_FLS.1/FW:: Failure with Preservation of Secure State (Firmware)

FPT_FLS.1.1/FW:: The TSF shall preserve a secure state when the following types of *firmware* failures occur: [_authenticity violation, integrity violation, rollback violation_].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _A DSC's ability to handle failures related to authenticity, integrity, and invalid versions of firmware is not applicable in all cases because some DSCs will have immutable firmware. This SFR must be claimed if [.underline]#mutable# is selected in FDP_MFW_EXT.1.1._
+
_The phrase "secure state" refers to a state in which the TOE has consistent TSF data and a TSF that can correctly enforce the policy. The TOE must ensure that no further processing of TSF or user data takes place while in an insecure state. This state may be the initial "boot" of a clean system, or it might be some check-pointed state. It is expected that in most cases, the TOE will halt and require a reset or re-initialization to return to a known secure state._

==== FPT_RPL.1/Rollback Replay Detection (Rollback)

FPT_RPL.1/Rollback Replay Detection (Rollback)

FPT_RPL.1.1/Rollback:: The TSF shall detect replay for the following entities: [_previous firmware builds_].

FPT_RPL.1.2/Rollback:: The TSF shall *prevent the execution of the loaded firmware and* perform *[.underline]#[selection, choose one of: [_assignment: other actions_], no other actions]*# when replay is detected.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _A DSC's ability to detect an attempted rollback (software/firmware downgrade) is not applicable in all cases because some DSCs will have immutable firmware that cannot be modified in any way. This SFR must be claimed if [.underline]#mutable# is selected in FDP_MFW_EXT.1.1._
+
_The TSF data is used as a guarantee of the ordinal identifier of the firmware instance. When a firmware load is requested, the TSF ensures the authenticated firmware ordinal identifier is greater than or equal to the previously authenticated firmware identifier. For example, this could be accomplished by ensuring the validated instance of the firmware to be loaded is greater than or equal to the instance previously validated and loaded into the TOE. By loading a previous instance of firmware, it potentially opens up the device to known vulnerabilities._

=== Trusted Path/Channels
==== FTP_CCMP_EXT.1 CCM Protocol

FTP_CCMP_EXT.1 CCM Protocol

FTP_CCMP_EXT.1.1:: The TSF shall implement CCMP using [.underline]#[selection: AES, Camellia]# in CCM mode and key size [.underline]#[selection: 128-bits, 256-bits]# as defined in [.underline]#[selection: IEEE 802.11i, IEEE 802.11ac]#.

FTP_CCMP_EXT.1.2:: The TSF shall discard incoming messages if authentication fails.

FTP_CCMP_EXT.1.3:: The TSF shall discard incoming messages that are malformed or invalid.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This SFR must be claimed if [.underline]#CCMP# is selected in FTP_ITC_EXT.1._
+
_Inclusion of this SFR requires inclusion of AES-CCM or CAM-CCM in FCS_COP.1/SKC._
+
_CCMP is defined in IEEE 802.11i. CCMP-256 is defined in IEEE 802.11ac._

==== FTP_GCMP_EXT.1 GCM Protocol

FTP_GCMP_EXT.1 GCM Mode Protocol

FTP_GCMP_EXT.1.1:: The TSF shall implement GCMP using [.underline]#[selection: AES, Camellia]# in GCM mode and key size [.underline]#[selection: 128-bits, 256-bits]# as defined in [_IEEE 802.11ad_].

FTP_GCMP_EXT.1.2:: The TSF shall discard incoming messages if authentication fails.

FTP_GCMP_EXT.1.3:: The TSF shall discard incoming messages that are malformed or invalid.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This SFR must be claimed if [.underline]#GCMP# is selected in FTP_ITC_EXT.1._
+
_Inclusion of this SFR requires inclusion of AES-GCM or CAM-GCM in FCS_COP.1/SKC._

==== FTP_ITC_EXT.1 Cryptographically Protected Communications Channels

FTP_ITC_EXT.1 Cryptographically Protected Communications Channels

FTP_ITC_EXT.1.1:: The TSF shall use [.underline]#[selection: CCMP, GCMP]# protocol to provide a communication channel between itself and [_assignment: list of entities external to the TOE_] that protects channel data from disclosure and ensures the integrity of channel data.

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This SFR must be claimed if [.underline]#cryptographically protected data channels as specified in FTP_ITC_EXT.1# is selected in either FDP_ITC_EXT.1 or FDP_ITC_EXT.2._
+
_Entities external to the TOE include applications that communicate with the TOE such as authentication capabilities (e.g. biometrics reader), external storage, and interfaces with an external DSC._
+
_If [.underline]#CCMP# is selected, the ST author must include FTP_CCMP_EXT.1._
+
_If [.underline]#GCMP# is selected, the ST author must include FTP_GCMP_EXT.1._

==== FTP_ITE_EXT.1 Encrypted Data Communications

FTP_ITE_EXT.1 Encrypted Data Communications

FTP_ITE_EXT.1.1:: The TSF shall encrypt data for transfer between the TOE and [_assignment: list of entities external to the TOE_] using a cryptographic algorithm and key size as specified in FCS_COP.1**/SKC**, and using [.underline]#[selection:#
+
* [.underline]#Pre-shared keys;#
* [.underline]#Key agreement according to FCS_CKM_EXT.7;#
* [.underline]#Keys exchanged using a physically protected communication mechanism conformant with FTP_ITP_EXT.1#
+
].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This SFR must be claimed if [.underline]#encrypted data buffers as specified in FTP_ITE_EXT.1# is selected in either FDP_ITC_EXT.1 or FDP_ITC_EXT.2._
+
_This requirement applies to encrypted data communications between the TOE and external entities that do not use a physically protected mechanism conforming to FTP_ITP_EXT.1, or a cryptographically protected data channel as conforming to FTP_ITC_EXT.1. For example, if data is transferred through encrypted buffers (or blobs) then this requirement applies. If data is transferred through a physically protected channel, then FTP_ITP_EXT.1 applies. This requirement would apply, for example, for communications implemented through a shared data buffer._

==== FTP_ITP_EXT.1 Physically Protected Channel

FTP_ITP_EXT.1 Physically Protected Channel

FTP_ITP_EXT.1.1:: The TSF shall provide a *physically protected* communication channel between itself and [_assignment: list of other IT entities within the same platform_].

_Application Note {counter:remark_count}_:: _This SFR must be claimed if [.underline]#physically protected channels as specified in FTP_ITP_EXT.1# is selected in either FDP_ITC_EXT.1 or FDP_ITC_EXT.2._

[appendix]
== Entropy Documentation and Assessment

This appendix describes the required supplementary information for each entropy source used by the TOE.

The documentation of the entropy sources should be detailed enough that, after reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide sufficient entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation is not required to be part of the TSS in the public facing ST.

=== Design Description 

Documentation shall include the design of each entropy source as a whole, including the interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the product.

The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.

This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate.

If implemented, the design description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included.

=== Entropy Justification 

There should be a technical argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence in the entropy source exhibiting probabilistic behavior (an explanation of the probability distribution and justification for that distribution given the particular source is one way to describe this). This argument will include a description of the expected entropy rate and explain how you ensure that sufficient entropy is going into the TOE randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with entropy.

The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any third-party application or from any state saving between restarts.

=== Operating Conditions 

Documentation will also include the range of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. It will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the entropy source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall describe the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction or become inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included.

=== Health Testing 

More specifically, all entropy source health tests and their rationale will be documented. This will include a description of the health tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at startup, continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, TOE behavior upon entropy source failure, and rationale indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in the entropy source.

== Glossary

.Glossary
[cols=".^1,.^3",options="header"]
|===

|Term
|Meaning

|Access 
|In the context of SDOs, access to an SDO represents the list of actions permissible with an SDO, including its generation, use, modification, propagation, and destruction.

|Administrator 
|A type of user that has special privileges to manage the TSF.

|Attestation 
|The process of presenting verifiable evidence describing those characteristics that affect integrity. Examples of these characteristics are boot firmware and boot critical data which, combined, describe the way the DSC booted. [SA]

|Attributes 
|Indications of characteristics or properties of the SDEs bound in an SDO.

|Authorization Value 
|Critical data bound to an action by itself or to action on a subject. Such data, when presented to the TOE, authorizes the action by itself or authorizes the action on or with the subject respectively.

|Authorization Data 
|Collective term for authentication tokens and authorization values.

|Authentication Token 
|Critical data bound to a user. Such data, when presented to the TOE and successfully verified by it, authenticates the user. The TOE may use the successful authentication of a user as an authorization to execute an action on its behalf.

|Authenticator 
|A shortened name for Authentication Token.

|Boot Critical Data 
|Critical data that persists across power cycles and determines characteristics of the DSC. Examples of boot critical data can be DSC configuration settings, certificates, and the results of measurements obtained by the RoT for measurement.

|Boot Firmware 
|The first firmware that executes during the boot process.

|Chain of Trust 
|A Chain of Trust is anchored in a RoT and extends a trust boundary by verifying the authenticity and integrity of successive components before passing control to those components. [SA]

|Client Application 
|Entity who relies on the services provided by the platform or DSC.

|Data Encryption Key 
|An encryption key, usually for a symmetric algorithm, that encrypts data that is not keying material.

|Integrity 
|Assurance of trustworthiness and accuracy.

|Immutable 
|Unchangeable.

|Key Encryption Key 
|An encryption key that encrypts other keying material. This is sometimes called a key wrapping key. A KEK can be either symmetric or asymmetric.

|Known Answer Tests (KATs) 
|Test vectors or data generated to determine the correctness of an implementation.

|Operator 
|Human being who has physical possession of the platform on which the DSC is located. [GD]

|Owner 
|Human being who controls/manages the platform on which the DSC is located. May be remote. [GD]

|Platform 
|A platform consists of the hardware and firmware of a computing entity.

|Pre-installed SDO 
|An SDO installed on the DSC by the manufacturer. The SDO consists of an SDE and attributes, which if not explicitly expressed in a data structure, are implicit based on the functions that have exclusive access to the SDE.

|Privileged Function 
|Functions restricted to the role of administrator, which may include, but are not limited to, provisioning keys, provisioning user authorization values, de-provisioning user authorization values, provisioning administrator authorization values, changing authorization values, disabling key escrow, and configuring cryptography.

|Protected Data Blob 
|Data in an encrypted structure that protects its confidentiality or integrity (as required by the context in which it is used).

|Protected Storage 
|Protected Storage usually refers to DSC hardware used to store SDEs or SDOs, and provide integrity protection for all items and confidentiality for those items that require it. Protected Storage may also refer to storage external to the DSC, which is usually encrypted by keys maintained by the DSC's internal protected storage capabilities.

|Protections 
|Mechanisms that ensure components of a DSC (executable firmware code and critical data) remain in a state of integrity and are protected from modification outside of authorized, authenticated processes and entities. [NIST-ROTM]

|Remote Secure Channel 
|Logical channel to the DSC from a remote entity, which cryptographically protects the confidentiality and integrity of the channel content.

|Root Encryption Key 
|An encryption key that serves as the anchor of a hierarchy of keys.

|Root of Trust (RoT) 
|A RoT performs one or more security specific functions; establishing the foundation on which all trust in a system is placed. [NIST-ROTM]

|RoT for Authorization 
|(As defined by [GP_ROT]) The RoT for Authorization provides reliable capabilities to assess authorization tokens and determine whether or not they satisfy policies for access control.

|RoT for Confidentiality 
|(As defined by [GP_ROT]) The RoT for Confidentiality maintains shielded locations for the purpose of storing sensitive data, such as secret keys and passwords.

|RoT for Integrity 
|(As defined by [GP_ROT]) The RoT for Integrity maintains shielded locations for the purpose of storing and protecting the integrity of non-secret critical security parameters and platform characteristics. Critical security parameters include, but are not limited to, authorization values, public keys, and public key certificates.

|RoT for Measurement 
|(As defined by [GP_ROT]) The RoT for Measurement provides the ability to reliably create platform characteristics.

|RoT for Reporting 
|(As defined by [GP_ROT]) The RoT for Reporting reliably reports platform characteristics. It provides an interface that limits its services to providing reports on its platform characteristics authenticated by a platform identity.

|RoT for Storage 
|A RoT that acts as the RoT for Confidentiality and the RoT for Integrity.

|RoT for Update 
|A RoT responsible for updating the firmware.

|RoT for Verification 
|A RoT responsible for verifying digital signatures.

|Security Data Element (SDE) 
|A Critical Security Parameter, such as a cryptographic key or authorization token.

|Security Data Object (SDO) 
|An SDO may include one or more SDEs. SDOs bind SDEs with a set of attributes.

|Symmetric Encryption Key 
|A value intend to input as a key to a symmetric encryption algorithm, such as AES.

|System 
|A system consists of the platform hardware and firmware in addition to the higher-level software running on top of it (kernel, user-space processes, etc.).

|Trusted Local Channel 
|Physical channel to the DSC within the platform of which the DSC is a part, which is protected by the operational environment to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

|User 
|An administrator or client application.
